        "Title": "Chartist Talks: SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah advises caution, picks these 2 bluechips",
        "Date": "2025-05-11",
        "Description": "Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 23,850-23,800 will act as a crucial support for the Nifty 50 next week. However, on the upside, the zone of 24,250-24,300 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Amid ongoing geopolitical tension between India and Pakistan, according to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, the historical pattern suggests that while initial volatility is common during such geopolitical events, the index has, in most cases, regained upside momentum once the dust settles.    He believes the current major trend of the Nifty 50 is still sideways to bullish but recommends adopting a cautious stance for the next couple of days.    The Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities is bullish on Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro, and Titan Company. &quot;Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro has surged above its short and long-term moving averages, and its daily RSI has surged above the 60 mark for the first time after March 2025, while Titan has given a breakout of the falling channel on Friday, accompanied by robust volume,&quot; he reasoned.    Historically, the impact of India-Pakistan tensions has been short-lived, given India's strong positioning, with markets often gaining healthy momentum once uncertainty clears. What is your view, and do you believe the April lows and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level (from the April low to the May high) are unlikely to be broken?    Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, the benchmark Nifty index managed to limit its losses, ending the week lower by just over 1%. However, it is important to note that the index continues to trade comfortably above its medium and long-term moving averages, indicating that the broader trend remains intact for now. However, the momentum indicators and oscillators portray a sideways picture. Now, the million-dollar question is, what\u2019s next in this uncertain time?    To offer some perspective, we have analysed data from the last three major geopolitical incidents between India and Pakistan \u2014 the Kargil War, the LOC strike after the Uri attack, and the Balakot strike following the Pulwama attack.    \u2022 During the Kargil War, Nifty initially experienced high volatility but then staged a sharp rally, surging nearly 36% during the conflict.  \u2022 Post the Balakot strike, the index delivered a strong return of over 10% in the 90 days that followed.  \u2022 The Uri strike was an exception, as Nifty declined by more than 8% in the subsequent 90 days. It\u2019s worth noting that this period also coincided with the announcement of demonetization, which weighed heavily on market sentiment.    The historical pattern suggests that while initial volatility is common during such geopolitical events, the index has, in most cases, regained upside momentum once the dust settles. Also, we would like to highlight that the current major trend of the index is still sideways to bullish. However, we recommend adopting a cautious stance for the next couple of days.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 23,850-23,800 will act as a crucial support for the index. If the index slips below the level of 23,800, then the 100-day EMA zone of 23,560-23,500 will act as the next crucial support for the index. On the upside, the zone of 24,250-24,300 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index.    How are FIIs and DIIs positioning themselves in the current war-like environment?    In the past few trading sessions, FIIs turned net buyers in the cash market, signaling renewed interest. However, it\u2019s worth noting that following Thursday night's escalation between India and Pakistan, FIIs turned sellers on Friday, offloading equities worth Rs 3,798.71 crore.    In the derivatives segment, their positioning also saw a shift. The FII long-short ratio in index futures had climbed to 52% on Thursday, which was the highest level since the first week of October 2024, hinting at growing bullish bets. But by Friday, this ratio slipped back to 47.71%, reflecting a more cautious stance.    Clearly, while FIIs have shown buying interest, the sudden geopolitical flare-up has made them tread carefully, indicating that sustained flows will depend on how the situation unfolds.    Do you expect the Bank Nifty to strongly defend the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the April low to the recent high? What are the key levels to watch next week?    After two weeks of consolidation, the banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has witnessed a consolidation breakdown and ended the week with a loss of over 2.50%. It has strongly underperformed frontline indices. The ratio chart of the index as compared to Nifty is marking the sequence of lower tops and lower bottoms.    Also, the index has slipped below its 20-day EMA level for the first time since April 11. The daily RSI is in the sideways zone, and it is in falling mode. This chart structure indicates consolidation along with a bearish bias in the short term.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 53,400-53,300 will act as immediate support for the index as the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally (49,157-56,099) is placed in that region. If the index slips below the level of 53,300, then the next crucial support is placed at 52,600 level. On the upside, the zone of 54,100-54,200 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index.    What are your top two stock picks for next week?    Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro    After the better-than-expected numbers, the stock of Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro has witnessed a consolidation breakout on a daily scale, and it is on the verge of giving a downward sloping trendline breakout. The trendline is formed by connecting swing highs from February 2025. Along with this, the stock has surged above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is surged above the 60 mark for the first time since March 2025. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,450-3,430 level with a stop-loss of Rs 3,350. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 3,650 in the short term.    Titan Company    The stock has given a breakout of the falling channel on Friday. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle, which adds strength to the breakout. Also, it has strongly outperformed frontline indices. Further, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,520-3,500 level with a stop-loss of Rs 3,400. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 3,750 in the short term.    Do you expect a pickup in momentum in Tata Motors, and Ideaforge Technology?    Both Tata Motors and Ideaforge Technology are exhibiting strong bullish momentum. On Friday, both stocks surged above their 100-day EMA levels, a positive technical signal. Additionally, their 20 and 50-day EMAs have started to slope upwards, indicating strengthening trend dynamics. Momentum indicators and oscillators are also pointing towards continued bullishness. Hence, we believe these stocks are well-positioned to extend their outperformance in the short term.

        "Description": "UBS said the current fiscal year could result in a broad-based earnings recovery for the consumer sector, with overall growth of 13 percent. ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The consumer sector seems poised for a rebound, noted international brokerage UBS, as several factors are aligning favorably. After a tepid FY2025, the current fiscal year could result in a broad-based earnings recovery for the sector, with overall growth of 13 percent.    The potential income stimulus from the lower taxes, coupled with the upcoming eighth pay commission over the next three years could spur a demand revival in a series of categories and add an extended earnings growth phase.    The valuations for the FMCG sector have corrected significantly, amid the broad-based sell-off in the sector. Valuations have moderated by around 35 percent since October, added the brokerage.    Further, the sector offers a defensive tilt to investors, in a market that could continue to have low risk tolerance amid global uncertainties. The sector could also continue to benefit if risk appetite returns.    UBS prefers value retailers Avenue Supermarts and Trent as income stimulus plays, as a result of their resilient value-driven retail model. Further, FMCG players Colgate-Palmolive and Britannia Industries are at an inflection points, as earnings growth revival could be likely be next year.    The brokerage also sees appealing value in ITC, after the stock has corrected around 12 percent over the past six months on taxation fears.    Out of all the consumption-themed plays, UBS least prefers Asian Paints, as a disruption cycle brings uncertainty, and Dabur India, as the Chyawanprash-maker has 'portfolio issues.'    Furthermore, UBS noted that Dominoes-operator Jubilant Foodworks has priced in a rebound for same store sales growth (SSSG).    UBS has made a series of rating changes across the FMCG space. Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Trent, and Colgate-Palmolive received upgrades to \u2018buy\u2019, while Jubilant FoodWorks, Dabur India, and Asian Paints saw downgrades to \u2018sell\u2019.        While UBS adjusted target prices across the board, the most prominent hikes were seen for Trent and Colgate-Palmolive. Avenue Supermarts, Godrej Consumer Products, and Britannia retained their \u2018buy\u2019 ratings, while Titan remained at \u2018neutral\u2019.    Over the past six months, the consumer staples gauge, the Nifty FMCG index, has cracked around 5.5 percent. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has slipped around a percent during the same time.

        "Author": "Broker Research",
        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Shriram Finance  Shriram Finance\u2019s (Shriram) Q4FY25 financial performance was subdued with a sharp NIM contraction and a spike in credit cost. While headline asset quality improved with GNPL falling to 4.55% vs. 5.38% QoQ, this was driven by higher write-offs at &amp;gt;INR 20bn during Q4FY25. Management\u2019s successful execution on balancing growth and credit cost derailed during Q4FY25 with credit cost exceeding its guidance of 2% and settling at 2.4% in Q4FY25. It attributes this to temporary slowdown in the CV portfolio in central India (certain pockets of UP, Bihar &amp;amp; MP) but also highlighted that the same is transient and sounded confident of maintaining full-year FY26 credit cost at 2%. The merger brought with it second wind for growth, which is progressively convalescing \u2013 FY25 growth at 17% YoY vs. STFC\u2019s timid FY19\u201323 spell of 9%/5%/7%/8%/14% on a standalone basis.  Outlook  Amid a challenging operating environment, we believe AUM growth would remain at 15% in FY26E/FY27E vs. 17% in FY25; higher forward flows in Q4FY25 also pose a risk to FY26 credit cost guidance of 2%. With this backdrop, we cut our FY26E/FY27E earnings by 4%/1% respectively, as we model marginally higher credit cost. We downgrade the stock to HOLD (Buy earlier) with a revised TP of INR 640 (INR 710 earlier), as we now value at 1.75x Sep\u201926E BVPS vs 2.2x on Sep\u201925E BVPS earlier.

        "Content": "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC  ITC reported a strong 6.5% volume growth in Cigarettes, ~39% growth in Agri business and sequential uptick in FMCG business(ex-notebooks) even as Paper Business continues to drag growth. ITC\u2019s margin continues to remain under pressure due to high leaf tobacco prices in Cigarettes, high wood prices and dumping (Indonesia and China) in Paper board, elevated commodity costs in FMCG and pricing pressure in stationary due to cheap imported paper.  Outlook  We estimate 8.9% PAT CAGR over FY25-27 post factoring in the demerger of Hotels business but without century paper integration. We believe ITC offers a favorable risk reward at 22.4xFY27 EPS and a dividend yield of 3.7%. We assign SOTP based target price of Rs530 (Rs538 earlier). Retain BUY.

        "Description": "Notably, the IT stocks have seen significant volatility in the recent days amid US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff flip-flops.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Several IT stocks declined on May 27, pushing the Nifty IT index down into the red to snap its two-day gaining streak and emerge as one of the top sectoral losers. This comes amid an overall downturn in the stock market, with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty being down over 0.7 percent each in the afternoon.    The Nifty IT index dropped 0.75 percent to close at 37,501.45. The index was only second among the top losing sectors, after FMCG. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Tech were each down 1 percent each, while Persistent Systems, Wipro and Infosys were each down over 0.5 percent each. LTI Mindtree, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis shares ended the session in the red with marginal losses.    Notably, the IT stocks have seen significant volatility in the recent days amid US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff flip flops. Trump had announced a slew of reciprocal tariffs in April, which was followed by counter measures by several nations. Analysts remained concerned over the possibility of a US recession as inflation was likely to rise after the tariffs.    IT companies, who derive a major portion of their revenue from US, saw a significant decline in the share prices amid the recession fears. However, Trump soon announced a 90-day tariff pause, which reduced recession worries and boosted the IT stocks.    However, the temporary pause is set to expire in July, leaving investors in a limbo as what to expect for the IT stocks.    Additionally, the firms\u2019 poor guidance for FY26 has further dampened investor sentiment. HSBC analysts have noted that while revenue growth has held steady for most large-cap players, a growing concern is the weakening trend in cash conversion, particularly in the mid-tier space in FY25. Cash conversion refers to a company\u2019s ability to translate its net profit into actual cash flow from operations. It is a key marker of financial health, revealing how efficiently a business collects receivables, manages costs, and generates liquidity from its earnings.

        "Content": "A strong rally in banking stocks pushed the Nifty Bank higher over 1.5 percent to around 55,500 level on April 28, snapping a three-day losing streak to emerge as one of the top sectoral indices, on a day of broadbased gains.    The shares of Punjab National Bank (PNB) were the top gainer on the Nifty Bank index, rising over 3 percent to trade at Rs 103 apiece. State Bank of India (SBI) shares followed, jumping over 2.8 percent to trade at Rs 821 apiece.    Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank shares were trading over 2.2 percent higher, while those of heavyweights Axis Bank and ICICI Bank were trading nearly 2 percent higher. Notably, the surge in the share price of Axis Bank comes after lender's Q4 results beat estimates. It had reported a net profit of Rs 7,118 crore in Q4FY25, marginally lower than Rs 7,130 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. According to Moneycontrol's poll, Axis Bank's profit-after-tax (PAT) was pegged 6 percent year-on-year lower at Rs 6,710 crore.    Federal Bank and AU Small Finance Bank were meanwhile trading nearly 1.5 percent higher each. IndusInd Bank shares were up around 1.4 percent. Notably, the stock is in focus today after the lender said that the board of the bank is taking 'necessary steps' to fix accountability of the persons responsible for the accounting lapses and realign roles and responsibilities of senior management.    Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and IDFC First Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.    On the technical aspect of the bank index, Shriram Group's Way2Wealth Brokers said, &quot;The overall trend remains bullish. Bank Nifty continues to form a higher high and higher low pattern on both the weekly and daily charts. The Super Trend indicate is positive, and it is trading above both short-term and long-term moving averages, which are sloping upward. Currently, support is placed at 54,176/54,000/53,150, while resistance is seen at 56,100. Traders should monitor daily price action closely and consider buying on dips, as the upcoming week could be volatile &amp;amp; the immediate intraday trend remains negative.&quot;    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Date": "2025-06-04",
        "Description": "The market is expected to remain rangebound and attempt to defend the previous day\u2019s low amid elevated VIX levels. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices wiped out opening gains and finished 0.7 percent lower on June 3, with the bears dominating market breadth. A total of 1,554 shares declined compared to 1,050 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to remain rangebound and attempt to defend the previous day\u2019s low amid elevated VIX levels. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    Oberoi Realty | CMP: Rs 1,797.3        After a remarkable up move over the last few weeks, Oberoi Realty witnessed consolidation near the resistance zone. However, the stock comfortably closed above its breakout zone, signaling a bullish continuation chart structure. This suggests that the uptrend is likely to persist. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,730 could act as the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend toward Rs 1,920 is expected.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,920    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,730    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 809.8        SBI has shown a robust rally from lower levels in recent sessions and is currently trading in an ascending triangle chart formation. This pattern indicates the potential for a breakout, paving the way for a new leg of up move from current levels. For positional traders, Rs 780 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level would suggest continuation of the uptrend toward Rs 865. However, a close below Rs 780 may prompt traders to exit long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 865    Stop-Loss: Rs 780    LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 608.1        LIC Housing Finance has given a breakout from its symmetrical triangle chart pattern, confirmed by a bullish candlestick formation and increased volume activity. On both daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a series of higher bottoms, further supporting a bullish outlook. Unless it trades below Rs 585, positional traders can maintain a positive stance and target Rs 650 in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 650    Stop-Loss: Rs 585    Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities    Great Eastern Shipping | CMP: Rs 976.6        Great Eastern Shipping has been in a larger consolidation phase over the past few months, forming a bullish chart pattern with higher tops and bottoms. The stock is now attempting an upside breakout of the 200-day EMA hurdle around Rs 990\u20131,000 levels. Volume expansion during this breakout, along with a positive signal from the 14-day RSI, indicates potential for further upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,085    Stop-Loss: Rs 925    Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers | CMP: Rs 160.32        RCF, a fertilizer stock, had been in a minor downward correction recently. On Tuesday, it witnessed a decisive breakout from its trading range and closed higher. The stock broke out near the crucial support of the 200-day EMA. Volume and RSI trends support the likelihood of more upside in the near term. The overall chart pattern suggests a long trading opportunity, and one may look to buy based on levels mentioned above.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 175    Stop-Loss: Rs 151    Signature Global India | CMP: Rs 1,258.7        Signature Global has been showing strong upside momentum over the past few months, forming a bullish pattern of higher tops and bottoms. The key resistance at the 200-day EMA was recently surpassed, and the stock is currently attempting to break above a downward-sloping trendline hurdle near Rs 1,270. Volume and RSI patterns are showing a positive bias, indicating further bullish potential.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,385    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,190    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    Valor Estate | CMP: Rs 205.74        In the previous session, Valor Estate gained more than 2 percent. On the daily chart, the stock had been forming a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern since October 2024. In the last session, it gave a breakout above the neckline at Rs 202, supported by a noticeable increase in volumes\u2014adding conviction to the breakout.    Additionally, the stock recently witnessed a Golden Crossover, where the 50-day EMA crossed above the 200-day EMA, which is a strong bullish signal. The RSI reading at 72 suggests there is still room for further upside momentum.    The first target based on the right shoulder projection comes near Rs 250 as a medium-term goal.    In summary, the current trend is positive. A decisive break above Rs 210 can move the stock price toward Rs 221, followed by Rs 235. On the downside, Rs 198 is the nearest support level to monitor.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 221, Rs 235    Stop-Loss: Rs 198    Brigade Enterprises | CMP: Rs 1,231.9        In the previous session, Brigade Enterprises rallied more than 4 percent, supported by a rise in volumes\u2014indicating strong buying interest. On the daily chart, the stock has formed a classic Rounding Bottom pattern, a bullish reversal structure. It gave a breakout above Rs 1,226 in the previous session.    Over the last five trading sessions, prices have consistently protected the previous candle\u2019s low on a closing basis, further confirming buyer dominance.    The Base Line (red line) of the Ichimoku Cloud acted as a key support during the recent up move, reinforcing the bullish trend. Moreover, the ADX (Average Directional Index) stands at 27, above the threshold of 25, suggesting the momentum is strong and likely to continue.    In summary, the current trend is bullish. A decisive break above Rs 1,240 could push the stock higher toward Rs 1,290, followed by Rs 1,350. On the downside, Rs 1,190 is the nearest support level.

        "Content": "Shares of SBI Life Insurance were the top gainers on Nifty 50 index, rising by over 7 percent in trade on April 25 following the March quarter results and positive comments by key brokerages.    Nomura has maintained its Buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,800, while Motilal Oswal also reiterated its Buy rating with a more optimistic target price of Rs 2,000.    The performance also reflected strong growth in renewal and first-year premiums, though it was offset by a sharp decline in single premiums.    For Q4FY25, total premium income fell 5.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 23,860 crore, primarily due to a steep drop in single premiums, which declined to Rs 4,462.55 crore from Rs 7,709.56 crore a year ago. However, the core business showed resilience \u2014 first-year premiums rose 7.3 percent to Rs 4,858.69 crore and renewal premiums grew 12.9 percent to Rs 14,680 crore.    On a full-year basis, total premium income increased 4.3 percent to Rs 84,059.83 crore. This was supported by a 10.9 percent growth in renewal premiums to Rs 49,407.79 crore, even as single premiums dropped 22 percent year-on-year.    SBI Life reported shareholders\u2019 profit before tax of Rs 1,105.83 crore for FY25, up 17 percent from Rs 947.59 crore in the previous year. Persistency also improved, with 13-month persistency at 86.64 percent, compared to 85.76 percent in the same quarter last year \u2014 a sign of better customer retention.    The solvency ratio stood at 1.96x as of March 31, 2025, comfortably above regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, the expense management ratio came in at 8.40 percent in Q4, reflecting the company\u2019s ongoing investments in digital capabilities and expanding distribution reach.    Despite some pressure from lower single premiums, the company\u2019s improving persistency, rising core premium income, and steady solvency position may help anchor investor confidence going forward.

        "Date": "2025-08-01",
        "Description": "HUL share price: Goldman Sachs upgraded HUL shares to 'Buy' from its earlier 'Neutral' rating, and raised its target price to Rs 2,900 per share.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) jumped nearly 8 percent on August 1, taking the stock's gains in two days to 12 percent. This comes after brokerages issued positive notes for the stock after the release of the firm's April-June quarter results.    Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on July 31 reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories. Revenue (total sales) grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore, with underlying volume growth (UVG) at 4 percent and underlying sales growth (USG) at 5 percent, HUL said in a stock exchange filing.    Profit after tax before exceptional items declined 5 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,526 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter stood at Rs 3,718 crore, marginally down from Rs 3,744 crore in the year-ago period. The EBITDA margin declined 130 basis points to 22.8 percent, in line with the company\u2019s guidance, as HUL continued to step up business investments.    Should you buy, sell or hold?    Goldman Sachs upgraded HUL shares to 'Buy' from its earlier 'Neutral' rating, and raised its target price to Rs 2,900 per share, from its earlier estimate of Rs 2,400 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 15 percent from the stock's previous closing price.    According to Goldman Sachs, HUL is witnessing a turnaround which is fuelled by a combination of macro factors and internal initiatives, according to the note cited by CNBC-TV18. The international firm is hopeful that HUL's revenue growth will speed up to high-single-digit levels by the second half of the ongoing financial year 2026 and in financial year 2027.    JM Financial retained its 'Buy' rating on the stock, but increased its target price to Rs 2,770 apiece. The domestic brokerage said that the firm\u2019s Q1 earnings were in line with its estimates. &quot;We like HUL's strategy pivot to focus on growth at the cost of near-term margin. Mgmt. commentary on outlook remains optimistic \u2013 volume recovery to continue, GM also expected to improve sequentially as pricing/NMI gap reduces. Consol. margin guidance remains unchanged at 22-23% (delivered closer to upper end in 1Q). With macro narrative improving along with clear step up in portfolio interventions by HUL, the worst seems to be behind. Initial benefits are visible with uptick in sales for Market Makers/Future Core portfolio &amp;amp; further gradual recovery in Core (GAL/Lifebuoy) should also follow,&quot; it added.    Motilal Oswal Financial Services kept a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 3,000 apiece. This implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock\u2019s previous closing price. &quot;The company plans to focus aggressively on volume acceleration, alongside new launches and the reactivation of its value proposition, which is expected to drive better growth in FY26,&quot; the domestic brokerage said.    HUL shares hit a day\u2019s high of Rs 2,727 in early morning trade. The stock later pared some gains to trade 2 percent higher at Rs 2,578 apiece.

        "Description": "Tapti oil and gas fields were operated by the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) joint venture under a production sharing contract with the Government of India. ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC on May 5 said that the companies have safely removed the mid and south Tapti field facilities on the Arabian Sea, thereby successfully completing India's first offshore facilities decommissioning project.    The project included removal of five wellhead platforms, related infield pipelines, load-in at the onshore dismantling yard and the safe plugging and abandonment of 38 wells, a joint statement said. &quot;Production from the Tapti fields ceased in March 2016, and this project demonstrates a high level of planning, coordination, and compliance with regulatory frameworks while upholding the highest safety and environmental standards,&quot; it further said.    Tapti oil and gas fields were operated by the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) joint venture under a production sharing contract with the Government of India. The JV comprised ONGC (With 40 percent participating interest), along with Reliance Industries and Shell (via its subsidiary BG Exploration &amp;amp; Production India).    Nipun Pradhan, Managing Director of BGEPIL and GM Shell Upstream India said, &quot;The safe and successful completion of the Tapti offshore project is a landmark moment for India\u2019s offshore energy sector. This project sets a new benchmark for responsible decommissioning, made possible by global expertise, strong collaboration, and an unwavering commitment to safety and sustainability. Shell is proud to be part of this historic journey alongside our partners Reliance, ONGC, and the Government of India.&quot;    Reliance Industries' President of E&amp;amp;P, Sanjay Barman Roy said, &quot;The safe and responsible offshore decommissioning by the PMT JV marks a significant step forward for India\u2019s energy sector. From the outset, the JV partners worked tirelessly to strengthen local supply chains and enhance the technical and safety capabilities of Indian contractors especially for offshore dismantling activities. This project has successfully delivered on the Indian Government's ambition of 'Make and Break in India'.&quot;    Pankaj Kumar, Director (Production), ONGC said, &quot;This first-of-its-kind large-scale offshore decommissioning underscores ONGC\u2019s commitment to responsible energy practices. The project\u2019s complexity, especially its proximity to ONGC\u2019s live assets demanded strategic planning, precise execution, and utmost focus on safety. It marks a defining moment in India\u2019s energy landscape and sets a strong foundation for the next chapter in offshore infrastructure transformation.&quot;    Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

        "Date": "2025-06-08",
        "Description": "Technically, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the Bank Nifty index. The daily RSI is quoting at 67.45, and it is in rising trajectory, which suggests strong bullish momentum.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Going ahead, Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities believes the Nifty 50 is well poised to test 25,200, followed by 25,500 in the short term, as all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the index.    Further, as per the measured rule of cup pattern, according to him, the upside target for Bank Nifty is placed at the 58,700 level, signalling a 3.75 percent rally from here on.    Among stocks, he is bullish on Poonawalla Fincorp, Arkade Developers, HDFC Bank, and Bajaj Finance. &quot;Poonawalla Fincorp has given a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily scale, accompanied by robust volume, while both HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance have given trendline breakouts on the daily chart, indicating a shift in momentum,&quot; said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    Do you think the falling resistance trendline breakout is sustainable in the Nifty 50 in the coming weeks?    &quot;The best trades often come wrapped in surprise announcements and clean technical setups.&quot; That\u2019s exactly what played out this week (ending June 6), as the Reserve Bank of India delivered a 50-basis-point rate cut \u2014 a move that not only surprised the Street but also acted as a powerful technical trigger across the market. Bank Nifty, which had been moving in a narrow consolidation band (Stage-2 Cup pattern) for over 31 sessions, broke out with conviction, backed by strong momentum. This was not surprising for us, as we had been consistently highlighting that Bank Nifty was gearing up for a breakout. Nifty, too, rebounded from the lower end of its consolidation range and is now on the verge of a decisive breakout, indicating a potential shift in market structure.    Adding further fuel to the bullish sentiment, the volatility index India VIX ended on a negative note for the second consecutive week. This week alone, it tumbled by 9 percent, signaling cooling market nerves and growing risk appetite among participants. Historically, a falling VIX, combined with price and volume breakouts, reinforces the sustainability of an uptrend \u2014 precisely the kind of technical environment we're witnessing now.    The Nifty closed the week near the psychological 25,000 mark. On the weekly chart, it formed a bullish candle with a noticeable lower shadow \u2014 a classic sign of buying interest at lower levels. Momentum indicators remain supportive, with all key moving average setups aligning in favour of the bulls. Most notably, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) has surged past the 60 mark and continues to rise, further affirming bullish strength.    Going ahead, we believe the index is well poised to test 25,200, followed by 25,500 in the short term. On the downside, the zone of 24,750\u201324,700 is likely to act as a strong support in case of any immediate pullback.    How are the FIIs positioning now, especially after Friday's move?    FII activity is currently showing mixed signals. While they were net buyers in equities during March, April, and May, they have turned net sellers so far in June. This indicates some hesitation or profit-booking amid global uncertainties or reallocation.    However, in the derivatives segment, the FII long-short ratio stands at just 20.87 percent, reflecting a heavy short bias. This suggests that much of the selling may already be priced in, leaving limited room for additional aggressive shorting. If the market continues its upward momentum, it could trigger short-covering by FIIs, potentially leading to fresh buying and renewed participation. So, while they may not be back in full swing yet, the setup is such that any sustained rally could act as a catalyst for a stronger FII comeback.    What is your June target for Bank Nifty, which has seen a breakout after several weeks of consolidation?    The Banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has given a stage-2 cup pattern breakout on the daily scale. Further, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on the breakout, which adds strength to the breakout. Also, it has marked a fresh all-time high.    Technically, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the index. The daily RSI is quoting at 67.45, and it is on a rising trajectory, which suggests strong bullish momentum.    As per the measured rule of cup pattern, the upside target is placed at the 58,700 level. While on the downside, the zone of 55,700-55,600 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.    What are your two picks for next week, considering the improved momentum?    Poonawalla Fincorp    The stock has given a horizontal trendline breakout on the daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle on the breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. The daily RSI has taken support near the 60 mark and thereafter witnessed a sharp rebound, which is a bullish sign as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 422-418 level with a stop-loss of Rs 400. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 460 in the short term.

Currently, the stock is trading above its short-term moving averages. Further, the daily RSI is in a super bullish zone as per RSI range shift rules.

        "Content": "Reliance Industries is carving out its fast-growing FMCG business from Reliance Retail into a separate unit, chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja said in a conference call after the company reported its quarterly earnings on July 18.    This business is in the process of being demerged out of Reliance Retail into a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, he said. \u201cOnce the regulatory approvals are in place, it will become an independent business.\u201d    Earlier this month, media reports said that Reliance is transferring all its consumer goods brands to a new wholly owned subsidiary as the billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led oil-to-telecom conglomerate prepares for an initial public offering of its retail business.    The brands, spanning apparel, fashion, food, personal care and beverages, currently housed under Reliance Retail Ltd, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, and Reliance Consumer Products Ltd will be moved to the so-called New Reliance Consumer Products Ltd, the reports said, citing a National Company Law Tribunal order dated June 25.    The conglomerate\u2019s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) vertical reported revenues of Rs 4,400 crore in the June quarter, marking a 2x year-on-year growth. Taluja attributed the surge to the company\u2019s expanding footprint across general trade, B2B, and its own store network. Total store count stood at 19,592 stores in Q1, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier. Since the March quarter, the company has added 252 stores.    \u201cWhile it has a big advantage of being able to sell through our network of stores, both B2C and B2B, the business has built its own independent distribution network, which is pretty substantial,\u201d he added. About 70 percent of the consumer business sales come from the general trade, according to the company.    Among its key brands, Campa Cola has gained double-digit market share in core markets, aided by a high-decibel marketing campaign during the IPL season.    &amp;nbsp;    Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

        "Content": "India's largest lender State Bank of India has approved the proposal to raise up to $3 billion as long-term fund in single or multiple tranches during FY26, the bank said in an exchange filing on May 20.    The funds will be raised through a public offer or a private placement of senior unsecured notes in US Dollar or any other major foreign currency, or both, said SBI.    &quot;the Executive Committee of the Central Board in its meeting held on 20th May 2025 has approved, inter alia, to examine the status and decide on long term fund raising in single / multiple tranches of up to US$ 3 Billion (US$ Three Billion) under Reg-S/144A, through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US Dollar or any other major foreign currency during FY 2025-26,&quot; SBI said in a statement.    The board of SBI had on May 3 okayed the plan to raise capital of up to Rs 25,000 crore in one or more tranches during FY26 through a Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), or Follow on Public Offer (FPO), or any other mode.    The chairman, CS Setty had said during the fourth quarter earnings call that the uncertainty over tariffs will impact the economy and the investment scenario. &quot;Without raising capital, the bank's growth will not be impacted. Benign asset quality is likely to continue for more period,&quot; SBI Chairman CS Setty said.    SBI's fund raise comes at a time other private lenders such as Axis Bank and IDFC First Bank too have sought to raise capital.",

        "Content": "Equity benchmark indices gained 0.5 percent on July 21 following a couple of days of correction, but the market breadth was slightly in favour of bears. A total of 1,392 shares declined compared to 1,295 advancing shares on the NSE. The continuation of the northward journey is possible only if the market posts a strong close above the 20-day EMA. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Hero MotoCorp | CMP: Rs 4,408.2        Hero MotoCorp recently consolidated within a tight range of Rs 4,150\u20134,375, forming a classic triangle pattern on the charts. On July 15, the stock broke out decisively from this formation, accompanied by a significant rise in volume, confirming the validity of the breakout. This technical strength is further supported by the Camarilla monthly pivot structure, which displayed an inside value relationship \u2014 a setup that often precedes sharp directional moves. The confluence of these factors suggests strong bullish potential in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 4,420\u20134,380 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,200    Varun Beverages | CMP: Rs 489.3        After undergoing a sharp correction of nearly 22% from its recent high of Rs 570, Varun Beverages has shown signs of a potential reversal. The stock has successfully breached a falling trendline on the daily chart, supported by a noticeable increase in volume \u2014 a key indicator of renewed buying interest. Adding to the bullish case, a positive RSI divergence is visible, reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Despite a 7% gain in the past week, the technical setup remains favourable, and a fresh long entry is still justified. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 490\u2013485 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 530    Stop-Loss: Rs 465    Sonata Software | CMP: Rs 438        Sonata Software formed back-to-back inside value relationships on monthly Camarilla pivots, signaling consolidation and strong buildup. A breakout on July 8 confirmed the end of this phase. Since then, the stock has entered a healthy pullback, finding strong support above Rs 420 \u2014 a key technical level. Holding above this mark suggests buyer strength, and if sustained, Sonata Software may resume its upward trajectory in the coming sessions, with potential for further gains. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 440\u2013430 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 500    Stop-Loss: Rs 405    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Bajaj Auto | CMP: Rs 8,438.5        Bajaj Auto has provided a breakout from the falling trendline, and there has been short covering in the stock, which is likely to extend post this breakout. Significant Call unwinding has been observed from the Rs 8,100 to Rs 8,400 strikes, coupled with Put additions at the Rs 8,100 and Rs 8,200 strikes, which is positive in the near term. Therefore, in this series, further short covering is expected, which could help the stock bounce back to the Rs 8,600 to Rs 8,800 levels. Traders may consider buying Bajaj Auto Futures in the range of Rs 8,460 to Rs 8,430.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 8,670, Rs 8,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 8,290    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 824.2        SBI has provided a breakout from the sideways consolidation and has retested the breakout level. It has been observed that the stock witnessed short additions during the previous fall, but since then, it has bounced back from its March lows due to short covering. Recent data now indicates long additions as well. The Options data shows that the Rs 820 and Rs 830 strikes have the highest Call base, but since the stock is trading well above its maximum pain level, the probability of these resistance levels being overcome is quite high. Traders may consider buying SBI Futures in the range of Rs 825 to Rs 820.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 850, Rs 870    Stop-Loss: Rs 814    Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,246.7        M&amp;amp;M has been forming a higher base with increasing long buildup, and it has more room for long additions as the price nears lifetime highs. However, the overall long positions are still away from their highs, indicating that the stock is not overbought. Once the lifetime highs are surpassed, it can witness further upward momentum.    The stock has witnessed significant Put additions at the Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 strikes, as well as Call unwinding at the Rs 3,200 strike, which is a positive sign. Although there is still significant Call writing beyond the Rs 3,200 level, the probability of upward momentum remains high as the futures data indicates that bulls have the upper hand. Hence, a meaningful close above Rs 3,300 will likely lead to further short covering in the Calls. Traders may consider buying M&amp;amp;M Futures in the range of Rs 3,370 to Rs 3,240.

        "Date": "2025-06-15",
        "Description": "Traders are advised to adopt a wait-and-watch approach in the next couple of sessions until a clear breakout or breakdown confirms the next leg of the move, said Sudeep Shah.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, the overall chart structure suggests that the market is currently positioned in \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d \u2014 stuck between key support and resistance levels, making directional conviction difficult.    Given the heightened geopolitical uncertainty and muted technical indicators, caution is key, he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.    He is bullish on Max Healthcare Institute, and Tech Mahindra, but believes Manappuram Finance is at overbought levels. &quot;Max Healthcare, as well as Tech Mahindra, has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale,&quot; the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities said.    Do you expect the Nifty 50 to remain in the 24,500\u201325,200 range in the coming weeks? What is the likelihood of further weakness?    In the first three trading sessions of the week, the benchmark index Nifty hovered near its 8-month high, yet remained confined within a narrow range of just 167 points. This tight consolidation reflected a clear state of indecision and a lack of strong conviction among market participants, as neither bulls nor bears were willing to take aggressive positions.    However, the calm broke on the weekly expiry day, when the index slipped below the consolidation zone, triggering a sharp intraday correction. The downside momentum intensified further on Friday after news reports confirmed that Israel had conducted airstrikes on Iran. This unexpected geopolitical escalation spooked investors and led to a broad-based sell-off across global markets, including a steep gap-down opening in our market.    Amid the global selloff, Nifty once again found support in the 24,500\u201324,450 zone \u2014 a crucial level that has acted as a reliable cushion multiple times over the past 23 trading sessions. Staying true to recent patterns, the index staged a strong rebound from this zone, recovering more than 240 points intraday and managing to close above the 24,700 mark. This recovery, though impressive, was not strong enough to decisively shift the trend, especially with external risks still looming.    Despite the bounce, the index continues to trade below its 20-day EMA, and the daily RSI remains directionless in a sideways range, indicating a lack of strong momentum on either side. The overall chart structure suggests that the market is currently positioned in \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d \u2014 stuck between key support and resistance levels, making directional conviction difficult. Given the heightened geopolitical uncertainty and muted technical indicators, caution is key. Traders are advised to adopt a wait-and-watch approach in the next couple of sessions until a clear breakout or breakdown confirms the next leg of the move.    Talking about crucial levels, 24,500-24,450 will act as crucial support for the index. If the index slips below the level of 24,450, then the next important support is placed at the 24,200 level. While on the upside, the zone of 24,850-24,900 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. If the index sustains above 24,900, then it is likely to resume its northward journey. In that case, it is likely to test the level of 25,200, followed by 25,500 in the short term.    Do you anticipate a further correction in the Bank Nifty, or is it entering a consolidation phase before the next leg of an upmove toward 58,000?    At this juncture, Bank Nifty appears to be in a corrective phase rather than a consolidation before a move toward 58,000. After hitting an all-time high of 57,049, it has started forming lower highs and lower lows on the daily chart clearly, indicating short-term weakness. The appearance of a Bearish Engulfing pattern on the weekly chart further confirms the possibility of a near-term reversal.    Additionally, the index has slipped below its 20-day EMA for the first time since May 9, 2025, and the daily RSI has turned bearish signaling limited upside potential for now. Immediate support lies in the 55,100\u201355,000 zone, and a breakdown below this may drag the index toward 54,400.    Until Bank Nifty reclaims its 20-day EMA zone of 55,700\u201355,800 and forms a higher low, a sustained upmove toward 58,000 looks unlikely. For now, further correction can't be ruled out.    Do you expect Brent crude oil futures to surpass $80 per barrel in the coming weeks?    Yes, Brent Crude has witnessed a sharp upside rally over the past week, driven by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. It has surged by over 11%, which has had highest weekly gain since April 2024. The geopolitical unrest has heightened supply concerns in the oil market, leading to a surge in prices.    Technically, it has surged above its 200-day EMA level for the first time after January 2025. Further, the daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. Going ahead, the zone of $76.50-76.80 will act as an immediate hurdle for the Brent Oil. If it sustains above $76.80, then it is likely to test the $80 level in the short term.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Max Healthcare Institute    The stock has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. As the stock is trading at an all-time high level, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. The weekly RSI is surged above 60 mark for the first time after March 2025, and it is in rising trajectory. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,240-1,230 level with the stop-loss of Rs 1,190 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,320 in the short term.    Tech Mahindra    The Nifty IT has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices since the last couple of trading sessions. The stock of Tech Mahindra has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale and started moving higher along with the higher volume. Currently, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising trajectory. Further, the daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is edging higher, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,660-1,650 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,600 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,760 in the short term.    Do the charts support a bullish view on Cochin Shipyard and Jubilant Ingrevia?    Cochin Shipyard    The stock has taken support near its 20-day EMA level and witnessed a minor pullback. Interestingly, the daily RSI has taken a support near 60 mark and thereafter witnessed a smart rebound, which is a bullish sign as per RSI range shift rules. However, for further upside, the stock needs to be sustained above the crucial hurdle of Rs 2,280-2,300 zone.    Jubilant Ingrevia    The stock has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on a breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Currently, all the momentum-based indicators and oscillators are showing strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we believe it is likely to continue its northward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.    Is Manappuram Finance currently looking overbought based on technical indicators?    Yes, Manappuram Finance has seen a strong rally over the last six trading sessions. The daily RSI is currently at 86.05, indicating that the stock is in an extremely overbought zone. While the momentum remains strong, such elevated RSI levels often warrant caution.

        "Date": "2025-07-09",
        "Description": "Jefferies said the consumer companies Varun Beverages, Hindustan Unilever, and Asian Paints were its top contra-ideas for the next 12 months.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Over the past few quarters, consumer firms have been plagued with faltering demand, rising competitive actions and margin pressures, weighing on their stock prices. According to international brokerage Jefferies, while there has been a gradual improvement in some of these issues, several stocks have factored in the risk.    This leads to limited downside in shares of certain consumption players, but a meaningful upside in case of a turn. As a result, Jefferies highlighted Varun Beverages Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, and Asian Paints Ltd as its top contra-ideas for the next 12 months, calling them 'fallen angels.' The brokerage even upgraded its rating on Asian Paints shares from 'underperform' to 'buy'.    Following the report, shares of Varun Beverages rallied 2.3 percent to Rs 468.6. Shares of HUL were quoting Rs 2,422.5, up 1.3 percent, while Asian Paints stock price was trading at Rs 2,503.6, up 0.8 percent on the NSE at 11.30 a.m. The gains in these counters also lifted the Nifty FMCG index, that was trading 0.7 percent higher at 55,937.10.    Consumer-facing categories, have been grappling with subdued demand over the past few quarters. This weakness was first visible in rural areas but has seen stabilisation in the recent past, along with some improvement too. Urban demand, on the other hand stayed resilient post Covid but now has shown signs of moderation, noted Jefferies.    Further, another challenge for the FMCG pack has been the lack of adequate product price hike which also impacted the industry revenue growth. This was partially due to sharp input cost correction in certain key inputs along with mix deterioration due to slowing premium product sales and increase in value packs or low-priced SKUs in certain cases.    Additionally, the impact of inflation has varied across companies &amp;amp; categories and hence had varying impacts on gross margins. High volatility in key inputs also made decision-making difficult as  some of the players adopted a wait and watch approach. As a result, margins actually witnessed pressure.    Given the margin pressure and lack of price hikes, stiff competition also weighed on the firms. Incumbents in some of the categories have also faced acute competitive pressures which has impacted across different levels including growth, market shares, ad investments, and profitability.    As a result, opportunities emerged. &quot;Led by the above factors, many of the stocks have underperformed sharply, with some even down as much as 25-30 percent from the peak.&quot;    Jefferies identified three names which offer reasonable-to-attractive risk-reward, with limited downside, as below:    Varun Beverages: At the time when concerns were brewing on increased competition, a weak summer has further added to the woes. While this requires 9-10% EPS cuts, on June 2026 basis, the stock trades at 43x P/E and appears attractive.     Asian Paints: Grasim's Birla Opus exerted severe pressures at a time when industry growth rates also softened along with certain management changes coupled with high input cost volatility. &quot;While Birla Opus will continue to ramp-up, we believe that the easy gains are already captured and expect a gradual recovery in earnings starting FY26 for Asian Paints,&quot; said the brokerage, upgrading the stock to 'buy' with a revised price target at Rs 2,830.    Hindustan Unilever: The stock has struggled on several fronts, most of which are highlighted above and this is reflected in the share price which has stayed flat for the last five years due to weak earnings trend. &quot;The recent change in stance by management on prioritising growth over margins along with parent's high focus on India should set the stage for recovery, and we retain buy,&quot; Jefferies noted.    According to Jefferies, &quot;none of the above names are cheap by any stretch of imagination&quot;, but the brokerage sees a potential for a cyclical upturn in the fundamentals, which should drive up share price. &quot;And in case our thesis does not play out, we think downside from current levels is limited,&quot; it added.

        "Content": "The Nifty Bank index sharply rebounded from day\u2019s low, amid a broad-based recovery in the stock market. This comes as the impact of Trump tariffs gradually faded away from the market.    After US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent tariff and a penalty on India, Indian benchmark indices opened in the red with significant losses. However, Sensex and Nifty sharply recovered all losses later.    Nifty Bank, which had declined more than 600 points in the morning to hit a low of 55,547, regained more than 750 points (1.4 percent) from that level to swing into the green territory. It is currently up nearly 150 points (0.27 percent) to stand at 56,300.    The recovery was led by private banks, with Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank leading gains, rising nearly 1 percent each. Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda shares gained more than 0.5 percent each. IDFC First Bank, HDFC Bank, AU Small Finance Bank and State Bank of India were hovering in the green with marginal gains.    Punjab National Bank (PNB) shares dropped 2 percent, after weak Q1 results. Federal Bank, IndusInd Bank and Canara Bank shares were hovering in the red with marginal losses.    On the technical front, the index has broken key resistance levels suggested by analysts. This may imply strong upside potential for the bank index. &quot;A sustained move above 56,275 could lead to a rally toward 57,000 and 57,630,&quot; said Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst - Research at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited.    &quot;The broader price structure continues to reflect a bullish bias, making dips a buying opportunity for positional traders,&quot; he said.    Motilal Oswal Wealth Management in its report stated that Bank Nifty's support is at 55,750, and then at 55,500. Resistance was quoted at 56,350, and then at 56,500. &quot;Now it has to hold above 56,000 zone for a bounce towards 56,350 then 56,500 levels while a hold below the same could see decline towards 55,750 then 55,500 zones,&quot; it said.    US President Donald Trump on July 30 announced 25 percent tariffs and an additional penalty against India ahead of the August 1 deadline. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described India as America's &quot;friend&quot; but added that it will face 25 percent tariffs plus a penalty for buying Russian military equipment and oil. The US President reiterated that India has among the &quot;highest tariffs in the world&quot;.    &quot;Seasoned investors know markets rarely reprice on the headline alone. Beneath the volatility lies a set of divergent sectoral narratives that deserve attention,&quot; said Bhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS.

        "Author": "Alpha Desk",
        "Content": "    State Bank of India (SBI) has significantly reduced its stake in Tamilnadu Telecommunications Limited, divesting 9,23,726 equity shares through open market transactions. This strategic disposal, which occurred over a period from December 14, 2023, to July 11, 2025, was formally disclosed by SBI on July 11, 2025, in compliance with regulatory mandates.  SBI's Shareholding in Tamilnadu Telecommunications Ltd.      Particulars  Number of Shares  % of Total Diluted Share/Voting Capital          Holding Before Disposal  42,47,500  9.30%      Shares Sold  9,23,726  2.02%      Holding After Disposal  33,23,774  7.28%        Action Details  State Bank of India (SBI) has significantly reduced its stake in Tamilnadu Telecommunications Limited, divesting 9,23,726 equity shares through open market transactions. This strategic disposal, which occurred over a period from December 14, 2023, to July 11, 2025, was formally disclosed by SBI on July 11, 2025, in compliance with regulatory mandates. The transaction involved the sale of shares carrying voting rights, with no other forms of voting rights or convertible instruments being part of this specific disposal.  Shareholding Impact  Prior to this disposal, SBI held a substantial 9.30% stake in Tamilnadu Telecommunications Limited, amounting to 42,47,500 shares. The recent sale of 9,23,726 shares, representing 2.02% of the target company's total diluted share/voting capital, has consequently brought down SBI's total holding to 33,23,774 shares. This revised shareholding now constitutes 7.28% of Tamilnadu Telecommunications Limited. The reduction in stake signifies a recalibration of SBI's investment portfolio, potentially aligning with its broader strategic objectives or capital allocation priorities.  Process and Timeline  The divestment was executed through the open market, a common method for institutional investors to adjust their holdings without direct negotiation. This approach allows for price discovery based on prevailing market conditions. The transactions spanned a considerable period, commencing on December 14, 2023, and concluding on July 11, 2025, the same day the disclosure was made to the stock exchanges. The phased nature of the sale suggests a deliberate strategy to manage market impact and achieve optimal realization for the divested shares.  Regulatory Context  This disclosure by State Bank of India is a mandatory requirement under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, and Regulation 29(2) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011. These regulations are crucial for maintaining transparency and ensuring that all material information regarding changes in significant shareholdings is promptly communicated to the public and regulatory bodies. Regulation 29(2) specifically mandates disclosures when an acquirer's shareholding crosses certain thresholds or undergoes significant changes, thereby protecting investor interests and preventing insider trading. The timely submission of such disclosures ensures that the market is well-informed about substantial changes in ownership, which can influence investor sentiment and the valuation of the target company.  Market Context  Tamilnadu Telecommunications Limited, the target company in this transaction, has its shares listed on prominent Indian stock exchanges, namely the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) and BSE Limited. The listing on these exchanges ensures that the company's shares are publicly traded, providing liquidity and a platform for investors to buy and sell. Disclosures like SBI's share sale are therefore critical for investors tracking the company, as they provide insights into the activities of major shareholders and potential shifts in corporate control or investment strategies.

        "Description": "The market may extend its rally if it decisively clears the previous week\u2019s high in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices gained some strength after a three-day consolidation, with the Nifty 50 rising half a percent on May 5. Market breadth also turned positive, as about 1,848 shares advanced compared to 740 declining shares on the NSE. The market may extend its rally if it decisively clears the previous week\u2019s high in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Honasa Consumer | CMP: Rs: 251.35        Honasa Consumer (Mamaearth) has recently staged a breakout following a prolonged consolidation phase within the Rs 200\u2013235 range, signaling a resurgence in bullish momentum. Notably, this consolidation occurred around the R3\u2013S3 levels of the monthly Camarilla pivot, a technically significant zone that adds weight to the bullish narrative. Furthermore, a bullish divergence on the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) lends additional confirmation to the potential for sustained upward movement. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 245\u2013255 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 300    Stop-Loss: Rs 224    Wipro | CMP: Rs 243.57        Over the past three weeks, Wipro has demonstrated consistent support near the Rs 200 high-low band on the weekly chart, indicating strong buying interest in the Rs 230\u2013240 zone. This accumulation area also coincides with the S1 Floor yearly pivot, lending additional technical strength to the support level. On the daily timeframe, a bullish divergence on the RSI further reinforces the positive bias and signals a potential reversal in momentum. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 236\u2013244 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 265    Stop-Loss: Rs 227    Godrej Properties | CMP: Rs 2,219.2        Godrej Properties has recently delivered a decisive breakout backed by strong volumes, following an extended consolidation phase within the Rs 1,900\u20132,200 range. The stock is currently trading around the Rs 2,250 level. Notably, a triple bottom formation was observed near the Rs 1,900 mark, accompanied by a positive divergence on the RSI, suggesting bullish momentum. This Rs 1,900 zone also coincides with a significant historical breakout level, which is now acting as a key support.    Interestingly, this support level aligns with the S3 Camarilla quarterly pivot, further reinforcing its strength, as highlighted in the accompanying chart. Traders may consider entering long positions between Rs 2,200\u20132,230.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,450    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,100    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    Elecon Engineering Company | CMP: Rs 578.9        Elecon Engineering has been in a strong uptrend since 2020, forming higher highs and higher lows within a rising channel. This month, it rebounded from the 34-month EMA (Exponential Moving Average) with a Morning Star pattern, signaling bullish mean reversion and renewed buying interest. On the weekly chart, the stock found support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of its previous rally, forming a double bottom\u2014a strong reversal signal.    Trading above its 12- and 26-week EMAs with rising volumes above the 20-week average and a bullish MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) crossover, the stock shows strong trend alignment and momentum, reinforcing its bullish outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 670    Stop-Loss: Rs 547    Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 199.32        Aditya Birla Capital has maintained a strong uptrend since 2020, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. This month, it broke above the high of the past three months, signaling a bullish trend resumption. The recent correction found support in the 50 percent\u201361.8 percent Fibonacci retracement zone of the Rs 85.60\u2013Rs 246 rally, indicating strong demand. A bullish MACD crossover further confirms positive momentum, reinforcing the stock\u2019s upward bias.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 224    Stop-Loss: Rs 189    Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,431.3        Reliance Industries has shown a strong structural shift across timeframes, signaling renewed buying interest. On the monthly chart, it broke out of a five-month consolidation in April with a bullish candle and a long lower wick, reflecting buying absorption at lower levels. A reversal from the 60-month EMA suggests a bullish mean reversion setup, reinforcing a positive long-term outlook. On the weekly chart, a double bottom and breakout from a falling channel confirm strong price development. Rising volume above the 20-week average and a bullish MACD further validate the breakout with strong momentum support.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,546    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,385    Eternal | CMP: Rs 240        Eternal (Zomato) has shown a structural shift after breaking out of a falling wedge bullish pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal. The stock is now firmly trading above its key 12-, 26-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, reflecting a positive trend. On the daily chart, it has started forming higher tops and bottoms\u2014an early sign of bottoming out. Additionally, a bullish crossover in the weekly MACD confirms that the improving price structure is supported by strengthening momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 267    Stop-Loss: Rs 230    Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 790        State Bank of India has given a strong breakout in an Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern formation on its technical charts. With the RSI (14) around 52 and the stock witnessing a re-test to the neckline, we feel that the stock is currently at an attractive risk-to-reward ratio and is forming a good setup. As per calculations of the Head and Shoulder pattern, when we add the length of the head to the neckline, we arrive at calculated price targets of Rs 860 and above. A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 760 to manage risk well in case the pattern is invalidated.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 860    Stop-Loss: Rs 760    Adani Total Gas | CMP: Rs 665.55        Adani Total Gas has given a strong breakout above its immediate resistance mark of Rs 655 and has successfully managed to close well above the same. With the RSI (14) placed at 65 and witnessing a sharp upside tick, we expect the stock to head higher toward potential targets of Rs 710 and above. With the stock breaking out above its trendline resistance as well as swing high resistance, it also witnessed a positive MACD crossover, which in turn shows strong signs of strength in the stock. A strict stop-loss should, however, be kept at the Rs 640 mark to manage risk well on this trade.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 710    Stop-Loss: Rs 640    ONGC | CMP: Rs 239.2        Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has touched its anchor VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) support mark of Rs 236.93 and managed to close well above the same, with a long wick rejection on its technical charts.    With the price touching its 5-, 9-, and 21-period EMAs along with the 50-period SMA, the stock looks well poised in terms of risk-to-reward ratio at current levels for a potential upside move. RSI (14), being around 48, is showing sideways momentum on the stock, but with the risk-reward ratio being favourable, we believe that momentum should soon strengthen and the stock should head higher toward potential targets of Rs 255 and above. A strict stop-loss should be kept at Rs 230 to manage risk well on this trade.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 255    Stop-Loss: Rs 230    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "LKP Research's research report on State Bank of India  State Bank of India (SBI) delivered a decent quarterly performance, supported by a robust broad-based loan growth and improved asset quality. While operating profit remained strong, earnings were impacted by elevated provisioning. The bank\u2019s NIM moderated on higher cost of deposits and is expected to remain range bound in the near term as deposit rates are expected to remain sticky despite recent repo rate cut. However, the impact of rate cut on margins is expected to be minimal due to its lower share of repo linked loans. Further, the bank\u2019s asset quality continues to remain strong, in a challenging macro environment with effective collection efficiency and robust underwriting. With its continued focus on digital transformation, strategic provisioning buffers, and healthy capital levels, SBI is wellpositioned to capitalize on improving macro conditions.    Outlook  Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP)-based target price of \u20b9907.

        "Content": "Banking stocks fell on April 23, snapping Bank Nifty's six-day gaining streak as the index took a pause from a recent rally, down nearly 1.3 percent from the highest level.    The selloff comes a day after the bank index hit a record high of 55,961 for the first time, including several bank shares touching fresh highs. The fall in share prices may be driven by profit booking after the recent upmove. So far this year, the Nifty Bank index is higher by 8 percent so far this year, having witnessed a sharp rebound since April 9.    On the technicals of the Bank Nifty index, Axis Securities said the trend-deciding level would be 55,617. &quot;If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 55991-56335-56709 levels. However, if it trades below 55617 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 55273-54900-54556 levels.&quot;    Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were the top loser on the index, falling 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,221.40 apiece. Heavyweight HDFC Bank followed, dropping over 2 percent each to close at Rs 1,920 per share. Notably, this comes a day after the private lender achieved the Rs 15 lakh crore-milestone following a sharp surge in share price, becoming the third Indian company to hit the level.    Canara Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) shares closed over 1 percent lower each. Federal Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank (PNB) meanwhile closed with marginal gains.    Despite the bearish trend, few bank stocks bucked the trend to trade in the green. AU Small Finance Bank shares surged nearly 8 percent to close at Rs 662 apiece. The sharp surge in the share price comes after the lender reported a 37 percent rise in net profit to Rs 2,106 crore in FY25. IDFC First Bank shares also gained over 2 percent to trade at Rs 68.34 apiece. IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank shares closed with marginal gains.    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 21 released the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) norms and assigned additional run-off rates of 2.5 per cent to internet and mobile banking enabled retail and small business customer deposits. Motilal Oswal in its latest report said that revised LCR framework is expected to enhance banks\u2019 funding and liquidity operations. &quot;We maintain our positive view on the banking sector,&quot; the brokerage said. It further said that its top picks among the bank stocks are ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI and AU Small Finance Bank.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on May 1 said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) sends a strong message of &quot;hope, unity and unshakable resolve&quot; after the terror attack in Pahalgam.    WAVES is being held at the Jio World Centre in Mumbai from May 1 to May 4. The summit, which will have an extensive list of speakers from the entertainment world, aims to boost the potential of the media and entertainment industry that reached a revenue of Rs 2.5 lakh crore in 2024.    Addressing the summit, Ambani said, &quot;We are truly blessed and deeply honoured by PM Modi's presence today. We know your extraordinary responsibilities \u2014 particularly after the recent barbaric terror attack in Pahalgam. Therefore, your coming here sends a strong message. A message of hope, unity, and unshakable resolve.&quot;    He further added, &quot;All of us gathered here offer our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims. Modi ji, you have the full support of 145 crore Indians in this fight against the enemies of peace, justice and humanity. Their defeat is certain. India\u2019s victory is also certain.&quot;    The RIL Chairman had earlier too strongly condemned the terror attack. Calling terrorism &quot;an enemy of humanity&quot;, Ambani said it must not be supported by anyone in any manner. &quot;We fully stand with our Honourable Prime Minister, the Government of India and the entire country in the decisive battle against the menace of terrorism,&quot; he had said.    At WAVES 2025, popular actor Rajinikanth said, &quot;After the Pahalgam attack, many told me that the government will postpone WAVES but I have confidence in my Prime Minister who can meet any challenge.&quot;    Singer Shaan expressed grief over the terror attack. &quot;Of course, there is grief in our hearts but as Raj Kapoor said - 'The show must go on',&quot; he said, referring to the late actor and directors.    Actor Jackie Shroff added, &quot;I pay my tributes to the families of the Pahalgam terror attack victims. Everyone is pained by it.&quot; When asked to comment on Pakistani actors' Instagram handles being banned in India, the actor said, &quot;We don't want to interfere in government policy and create controversy.&quot;    Follow our LIVE blog on WAVES 2025.    &amp;nbsp;    Mukesh Ambani further said, &quot;PM Modi gave a green signal for this summit a few months ago and his idea was to amplify India's voice at the world stage. We have representatives from 90 countries. This is 'Josh' of 'Naya Bharat' - Bold in its dream and fast in its execution.&quot;    (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

        "Description": "Emkay Global Financial is bullish on State Bank of India has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 975 in its research report dated May 04, 2025.",
        "Author": "Broker Research",
        "Content": "Emkay Global Financial's research report on State Bank of India  SBI posted a slightly soft quarter, as credit growth moderated to 12.4% YoY due to pre-payments in the corporate book, while higher opex (staff cost + deposit insurance) and provisions (std assets + investment + PLI incentive) caused a 5% earnings miss, with PAT at Rs186bn/1.1% RoA. SBI expect credit growth of 12-13% in FY26, while margins could contract in view of the recent sharp rate cuts albeit gradually, given the higher share of MCLR loans. Asset quality would remain healthy, as also the credit cost. This, coupled with treasury gains, should support SBI\u2019s RoA at ~1.1% in FY26E. The mgmt avoided comments on the adverse SC judgement regarding Bhushan Power (recovered Rs40bn/0.9% of FY25 networth). However, our discussions with other PSBs suggest that they shall reverse the recovery once the final judgement on the review petition is declared and, in fact, look for a better recovery rate (over 40%) in case the a/c is presented for re-bidding, thus becoming net beneficiaries.  Outlook  Building in some growth slowdown and margin contraction, we cut FY26-27E earnings by 4-5% and our TP by 5% to Rs975 from Rs1,025, valuing the SA bank at 1.2x FY27E ABV/subs at Rs270/sh; retain BUY, given attractive valuations (0.9x FY27E ABV) for healthy RoA/RoE @1-1.1%/16-17%.

        "Content": "FMCG major ITC's Chairman Sanjiv Puri said on July 25 that the company plans to invest Rs 20,000 crore in the medium term to ramp up business footprint across sectors.    He was speaking at the annual general meeting held in Kolkata, where he said the company is committed to boost the Make in India initiative and has built 40 manufacturing assets across India. Speaking at the AGM, he said the company has already set up eight manufacturing sites in recent years as part of its growth strategy, in areas such as FMCG, sustainable packaging, and export-oriented value-added products.    Sanjv Puri underscored the challenges to business in current times and called for efforts to redefine growth. &quot;We are navigating a pivotal inflection point shaped by turbulence, uncertainty and rapid changes that calls for novel strategies to reimagine the future.&quot; Puri added that it is 'imperative' to redefine growth and adopt a new paradigm of 'compassionate capitalism'.    &quot;The year gone by saw challenges from a weak external sector, dumping of imports, and inflationary pressure leading to softening of demand,&quot; Sanjiv Puri said. ITC is slated to declare its June quarter results on August 1, 2025.    To sustain India's growth trajectory, ITC Chairman backed the need for 'strategic' supply chain decisions and an effort to 'redouble' much larger value addition in the economy, while stating that new brand launches are aimed at driving 'value accretion'. As much as 65 percent of the company's revenue now comes from its non-cigarette business, the Chairman said. Since FY21, the FMCG segment has increased revenue from Rs 14,700 crore to around Rs 22,000 crore in FY25.    The foodtech business is being seen as a new lever in ITC's next leg of growth, ITC Chairman said, and the business has generated a CAGR of 108 percent in three years since inception. &quot;A full stack foodtech platform has scaled up to 60 cloud kitchens across five cities and is now progressively being introduced across India,&quot; Sanjiv Puri said.    &quot;The year gone by saw challenges from weak external sector, dumping of imports inflationary pressure leading to softening of demand. However, the future outlook remains promising on the back of continued thrust on reforms,&quot; ITC chairman said.",

        "Date": "2025-05-05",
        "Description": "Although the majority of brokerage firms maintain a bullish stance on the stock, a number of them have revised their earnings estimates downward for FY26 and FY27",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) slipped 1 percent to Rs 791 per share on May 5, following the announcement of its mixed March quarter results. While most brokerage firms continue to maintain a bullish outlook on the stock, several have lowered their earnings estimates for FY26 and FY27.    Analysts at Motilal Oswal have reiterated their \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock, maintaining a target price of Rs 915 per share. However, they have reduced their earnings projections for FY26 and FY27 by 4.6 percent and 5 percent, respectively, citing higher provisioning levels and ongoing margin pressures.    Catch all the LIVE market action on our blog    The brokerage noted, \u201cEarnings were in line with expectations, with treasury gains cushioning the impact of elevated operating expenses and provisions. The bank has guided for loan growth of 12\u201313 percent, and asset quality ratios have shown improvement. However, an expected reduction in the repo rate is likely to exert pressure on margins going forward. We forecast Return on Assets (RoA) and Return on Equity (RoE) for FY27 at 1 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively.\u201d    Nuvama Institutional Equities also maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, assigning a higher target price of Rs 950 per share. The firm stated that SBI\u2019s performance, driven by stronger-than-industry loan growth and consistent asset quality continues to support a positive outlook.    \u201cMargins found some relief after two consecutive quarters of decline. Among peers, SBI recorded the highest sequential loan growth, and margins remained stable after nine months of downward movement,\u201d Nuvama commented.    SBI reported a 9.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in net profit, which stood at Rs 18,643 crore for Q4FY25. This drop was mainly due to the absence of a one-time provision write-back that had bolstered earnings in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, along with a rise in provisions. However, robust trading and foreign exchange income helped support overall profitability. On a sequential basis, net profit rose by 10.4 percent, up from Rs 16,891 crore in Q3FY25.    Net Interest Income (NII) for the quarter rose 2.69 percent YoY to Rs 42,775 crore, and increased 3.21 percent compared to the previous quarter.    Meanwhile, the bank\u2019s domestic Net Interest Margin (NIM) fell by 32 basis points YoY to 3.15 percent in Q4FY25, down from 3.47 percent in the same period last year.    Discussing the outlook post-results, SBI Chairman C.S. Setty stated, \u201cGiven the current benign interest rate environment, we anticipate further rate cuts\u2014possibly another 50 basis points in total, with 25 basis points in the next policy announcement. This will undoubtedly put pressure on margins. Some parts of our lending portfolio get re-priced immediately with a rate cut, but deposit re-pricing tends to lag, typically taking 12 to 18 months for the existing deposit stock to adjust.\u201d    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Date": "2025-04-28",
        "Description": "Sensex, Nifty rebounded over 1 percent on Monday amid a sharp rally in index heavyweight Reliance Industries and the robust foreign inflows.  ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Sensex and Nifty rebounded over 1 percent on Monday in a holiday-shortened week amid a sharp rally in blue-chip stock Reliance Industries and the robust foreign inflows. A firm trend in global markets also propelled rally in the domestic equities.    Reliance Industries, Bharat Electronics, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv and Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra were among the top gainers in today's market session.    The Sensex jumped 1,005.84 points or 1.27 percent to settle at 80,218.37. During the day, it surged 1,109.35 points or 1.40 percent to 80,321.88. The NSE Nifty rallied 289.15 points or 1.20 percent to close at 24,328.50.    Here are the key factors behind the market rise today:    1) Buying in index heavyweight: Reliance Industries shares jumped 5.27 percent to emerge as the top gainer on the Nifty50 pack, after the Mukesh Ambani-led index heavyweight beat earnings estimates for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025.    Reliance Industries' strong rally contributed 220 points to the Nifty 50, while ICICI Bank's two percent jump added nearly 100 points to the index. However, Shriram Finance and HCL Technologies capped the gains.    The company's net profit attributable to shareholders grew 2.4 percent to Rs 19,407 crore for Q4 FY25, beating Street expectations, as a result of lower depreciation, interest and tax rate. Revenue for the three months ended March 31 climbed 8.8 percent from a year ago to Rs 2.88 lakh crore, driven by company\u2019s digital services, retail and oil-to-chemicals business.    Reliance Industries shares soar on Q4 profit    2) Easing fears of full scale India-Pak war: The investors seems to have shrugged-off fears of the rising geopolitical developments between India and Pakistan after the equity markets witnessed profit-taking in the previous two sessions due to escalating tensions following the death of 26 people in a terror attack on tourists at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir.    VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments noted that going by the resilience of the market, it can be said that the market has not discounted a scenario of the tensions culminating in a war between the two countries. &quot;It is important to remember that markets have an uncanny ability to surprise by climbing many walls of worries,&quot; he added.    Stock Market LIVE Updates    3) Robust FII inflows: Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 2,952.33 crore on Friday. Foreign investors have infused Rs 17,425 crore in the country's equity markets last week, supported by a combination of favourable global cues and strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. This came following a net investment of Rs 8,500 crore in the preceding holiday-truncated week ended April 18.    &quot;FIIs have turned sustained buyers in a dramatic reversal of their sustained selling strategy. This, in turn, is due to the relative under performance of US stocks, US bonds and dollar. In an environment of weakening US economy and depreciating dollar FIIs may continue to buy providing support to the market,&quot; added VK Vijayakumar.    4) Positive global cues: In Asian markets, South Korea's Kospi index, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were trading in the positive territory while Shanghai SSE Composite quoted lower. U.S. stock markets rallied significantly, with all major indices posting substantial weekly gains as reports suggested easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Potential agreements with other trading partners further bolstered market sentiment.    What technical analysts suggest?    Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Investments noted that an evening star formation followed by Friday\u2019s solid down move has unfolded at the top of a relentless up move that has been on since the 7th of April.    &quot;Ideally this down move aims for the 23300-23050 region, with initial support seen near 23670. Meanwhile, the support offered by the March peak, from which a pullback was staged in the dying hours of Friday lends some hope for a quick resumption of uptrend, without a long-drawn correction. However, for this, Nifty needs to remain above 24190, in which case 24500-850 could come back into the horizon. For opening trades, we will keep 23950-24070 as the key pivots,&quot; he added.

        "Content": "ITC Ltd on August 1 reported its standalone net profit was flat at Rs 4,912 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as elevated input costs for edible oil, wheat,  maida, cocoa, continue to pressure margins. The company reported net profit of Rs Rs 4,917 crore in the same quarter last year.    The June quarter results of ITC Ltd misses estimates as a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages pegged its net profit at Rs 5,000 crore in Q1FY26.    EBITDA was up 3 per cent YOY at Rs 6,261 crore, including the impact from the subdued paper business. On a consolidated basis, net profit rose 3 per cent to Rs 5,343.4 crore.    &quot;High frequency indicators for the quarter suggest mixed trends. Buoyancy in agriculture &amp;amp; service sector, moderating inflation and rural wage growth are some of the key positives; on the other hand, industrial growth, automobile sales, credit growth and electricity &amp;amp; fuel consumption remain subdued,&quot;the company said in a statement on August 1.    However, the conglomerate's revenue rose 20 per cent  to Rs 21,059 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 17,593 crore a year ago, driven by strong sales from cigarettes, agri business and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses.    The FMCG-to-cigarettes conglomerate said it expects lower inflation, reduction in interest rates &amp;amp; liquidity support by RBI and  tax cuts along with front loading of government expenditure to &quot;bolster the growth momentum going forward&quot;.

Segment results     Standalone cigarette business' revenue rose 7.7 per cent to Rs 8,520 crore in the quarter, while profit was up 3.7 per cent at Rs 5, 145 crore. ITC flagged margin impact from the consumption of high-cost leaf inventory which it partly mitigated through cost management initiatives and improved product mix.    Meanwhile, FMCG business, which owns brands like Aashirvaad and Sunfeast, reported revenue of Rs 5,777 crore, up 5.2 per cent YOY, on a standalone basis.  Notebooks industry continues to operate under deflationary conditions on account of low-priced paper imports and opportunistic play by local/regional players, also  unseasonal rains during the quarter impacted beverages sales, the company said. The segment profit was down 16 per cent at Rs 398 crore in the quarter impacted by high commodity costs.    Revenue from agri business rose 38.9 per cent at Rs 9, 685 crore and profit rose 21.0 per cent YOY at Rs 434 crore.    Revenue from Paperboards, Paper &amp;amp; Packaging business rose 7 per cent at Rs 2, 116 crore but the segment posted a 37.8 per cent decline in profit asLow-priced supplies into global markets including India, subdued realisations and elevated wood prices continue to impact Industry performance, the company said in an investor presentation.",

        "Date": "2025-07-30",
        "Description": "The market is expected to remain rangebound and consolidative in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices rallied for the first time in the last four sessions, with the Nifty 50 rising 0.57 percent on July 29. The market breadth was also supported by the bulls. A total of 1,744 shares advanced compared to 916 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain rangebound and consolidative in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    Lupin | CMP: Rs 1,984.6        After a decline from higher levels, Lupin rebounded from its support zone and witnessed a steady recovery. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The recent upmove suggests a new leg of the bullish trend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,910 could act as the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend toward Rs 2,120.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,120    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,910    LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 598.25        After a short-term price correction, LIC Housing Finance is now available near its multiple support zones. The bullish momentum near the support area indicates that the downside is likely restricted. Therefore, the current rebound in the stock is expected to continue with a favourable risk\u2013reward profile. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 575, the bullish texture is likely to continue. A move above this level could take the stock to Rs 640.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 640    Stop-Loss: Rs 575    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 799.20        After a remarkable upmove on a weekly basis, SBI witnessed profit booking at higher levels. Following the recent selloff, the downward momentum appears to have paused. Moreover, the counter has found support near its multiple demand zones. The formation suggests a potential revival of the uptrend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 770 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level would suggest continuation of the uptrend towards Rs 850. However, a close below Rs 770 may prompt traders to exit long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 850    Stop-Loss: Rs 770    Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities    Tata Chemicals | CMP: Rs 1,000        After a rangebound action over the past few weeks, Tata Chemicals witnessed a sharp upside breakout this week amidst volatility in the benchmark indices. The stock price moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation range at Rs 960 on Tuesday and closed higher. Hence, there is a strong possibility of further upside momentum in the near term. Volumes have started to expand during the breakout, and the daily 14-period RSI shows a positive signal.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,105    Stop-Loss: Rs 940    Syngene International | CMP: Rs 711.4        Syngene has been forming a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart over the past few months. The current weekly candle pattern indicates a decisive upside breakout following the formation of a higher bottom at Rs 621 earlier this month. Volume has expanded during the breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI shows a bullish indication.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 785    Stop-Loss: Rs 670    PI Industries | CMP: Rs 4,249.5        PI Industries has been in a decisive upside rally for the last 3\u20134 months. A bullish structure of higher tops and bottoms is visible on the weekly timeframe chart. After a minor downward correction recently, the stock is now poised to surpass the crucial hurdle around Rs 4,250 this week. Volume expanded on Tuesday during the upside breakout, and the weekly 14-period RSI pattern suggests more upside ahead.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,675    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,050    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    Man Industries | CMP: Rs 454.8        Man Industries has been moving in a higher-high, higher-low structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. In the previous session, the price managed to break out of its Rs 405\u2013448 range with a gain of over 5%, which is a strong bullish sign. Last week, the price found support at the baseline (red) of the Ichimoku Cloud and rebounded nearly 9%. The medium-term support as per this indicator is near Rs 425. Additionally, the ADX is at 35, well above 25, indicating positive momentum is likely to continue. A break above Rs 461 can lift the price toward Rs 480 followed by Rs 500.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 480, Rs 500    Stop-Loss: Rs 442    Escorts Kubota | CMP: Rs 3,489.8        In the prior session, Escorts Kubota gained more than 2%. Last week, prices retested the downward-sloping trendline and are now near the previous swing high of Rs 3,500, suggesting growing bullish activity. A decisive break above this level could further boost positive momentum.    Furthermore, the 15-period and 30-period EMAs have recently formed a bullish crossover. As long as this crossover remains intact, the daily bias remains on the bullish side. Escorts Kubota is currently on the verge of a breakout. A move above Rs 3,500 could lead to a trending rally toward Rs 3,620 followed by Rs 3,730.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,620, Rs 3,730    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,380    Coromandel International | CMP: Rs 2,495.4        In the previous session, Coromandel International gained more than 3%. The stock has managed to hold above the prior day\u2019s low for the last seven trading sessions, which is a positive sign. On the daily chart, the stock is trading in a rectangular range between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,520 since May 2025, indicating accumulation. A close above Rs 2,520 could result in a bullish breakout from this pattern.

The floor price represents nearly 2.5% discount from the current price of SBI share.    In a stock exchange filing, the lender said it launched a share sale to institutional investors.    &quot;...the Committee of Directors has, at its meeting held today i.e. July 16, 2025, inter alia, passed resolutions for the following: a. Authorising opening of the Issue today, i.e., July 16, 2025; b. Approving the Floor Price for the Issue, being \u20b9 811.05 per Equity Share, (\u201cFloor Price\u201d), based on the pricing formula as prescribed under the SEBI ICDR Regulations,&quot; said SBI.    On July 16, SBI shares on NSE closed 1.7% higher at Rs 830.5 apiece.    In May 2025, the bank said it received its board approval to raise equity capital aggregating up to Rs 25,000 crore in one or more tranches during FY2026 through QIP/ follow-on public offer (FPO) or any other permitted mode.    Earlier on July 16, CNBC-Awaaz reported that Life Insurance Corporation of India is likely to be anchor investor with Rs 7,000-crore bid.    The QIP is part of SBI\u2019s broader plans to support loan growth, strengthen its balance sheet and meet regulatory requirements. It\u2019s also the first time since 2017 that the lender, majority owned by the government, tapped the equity market.    SBI has shortlisted six investment banks to manage the transaction, including the Indian arms of Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc, as well as ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley, and SBI Capital Markets Ltd., Bloomberg News reported earlier.    The state-owned bank had last tapped the QIP route in the financial year 2017-18 (Apr-Mar), raising Rs 15,000 crore.    Separately, State Bank of India board on July 16 approved raising up to Rs 20,000 crore through bonds in FY26.    &quot;The Central Board of the Bank in its meeting held today i.e. 16.07.2025 accorded approval for raising funds in INR by issue of Basel III compliant Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 Bonds, up to an amount of Rs 20,000 crore to domestic investors during FY26, subject to GOI approval wherever required,&quot; said the PSU lender in a stock exchange filing.",

        "Date": "2025-06-27",
        "Description": "SBI, India's largest lender, is planning to raise funds through the issuance of Basel III-compliant tier-II bonds with a 10-year or 15-year maturity in July or August, news agency Reuters has reported citing sources.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is likely to raise funds worth nearly Rs 5,000 crore through debt instruments over the next two months, news agency Reuters reported on June 27 citing people familiar with the matter, helping the shares sustain early gains of nearly a percent on a day the Bank Nifty extended its rally to record highs.    The PSU lender is planning to raise funds through the issuance of Basel III-compliant tier II bonds with a 10-year or 15-year maturity, in July or August, the report said citing sources, with initial talks having begun and the duration of the bond issuance would be finalized considering the rate at the time of issuance, the report added.    One source told the news agency that the 15-year bond structure could be explored with a call option at the end of 10 years.    Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report.    Earlier in May, SBI had approved the proposal to raise up to $3 billion as long-term fund in single or multiple tranches during the ongoing FY26 through a public offer, or a private placement of senior unsecured notes in US Dollar or any other major foreign currency.    SBI Chairman CS Setty had said during the fourth quarter earnings call that the uncertainty over tariffs will impact the economy and the investment scenario. &quot;Without raising capital, the bank's growth will not be impacted. Benign asset quality is likely to continue for more period,&quot; SBI Chairman CS Setty had said.    The public lender had earlier raised Rs 7,500 in September last year through 15-year tier II bonds, which had a call option at the end of 10 years. In the previous financial year (FY25), the bank had raised 150 billion rupees through tier II bonds.    Also Read: Nifty Bank hits new all-time high again, tops 57,400 for the first time ever    On June 25, Bloomberg News had reported citing people familiar with the development that State Bank of India had selected investment bankers including Citigroup and HSBC to manage the share sale. SBI has also chosen ICICI Securities, Kotak Capital, Morgan Stanley and SBI Capital for the fundraise, the report added.",

        "Content": "The benchmark indices were under severe pressure on April 1, falling 1.5 percent on the Nifty 50, extending losses for the second consecutive session. However, the breadth was in favour of the bulls, with 1,773 shares gaining compared to 845 shares that corrected on the NSE. The market is expected to be range-bound in the upcoming session. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research, Kotak Securities    Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 90        After the remarkable up move, Canara Bank is taking a breather in the last few sessions. The consolidation within a rangebound structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 97    Stop-Loss: Rs 87    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance | CMP: Rs 569        After the recent selloff from the higher levels, the downward momentum has halted. On daily charts, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has found support and reversed its trend from an important retracement zone, accompanied by decent volume activity. This formation suggests further bullish movement from the current levels in the coming horizon.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 610    Stop-Loss: Rs 550    Bikaji Foods International | CMP: Rs 692        Following a decline from the higher levels, Bikaji Foods International rebounded from its demand zone and witnessed a steady recovery from lower levels. Additionally, on the daily charts, the stock has given a breakout from its sloping channel formation. The gradual upward moves suggest the start of a new bullish trend from the current levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 740    Stop-Loss: Rs 665    Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities    Karur Vysya Bank | CMP: Rs 214.09        Karur Vysya Bank has reclaimed its level above both the 50-day and 200-day EMAs. During the week ended March 21, 2025, the stock formed a bullish &quot;Engulfing&quot; candlestick pattern on the weekly charts. The stock price has been rising along with healthy volumes.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 249    Stop-Loss: Rs 183    Godawari Power &amp;amp; Ispat | CMP: Rs 189.45        The price of Godawari Power &amp;amp; Ispat has broken out from a bullish Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern on the daily chart. The stock price has been rising with an increase in volumes and is positioned above all important moving averages, indicating a bullish trend across all time frames. RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) have turned bullish on the daily charts. The metal sector has regained its bullish momentum, which is likely to continue.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 215    Stop-Loss: Rs 176    Torrent Power | CMP: Rs 1,500.3        Torrent Power has been forming a bullish &quot;Flag&quot; pattern on the daily chart and is on the verge of breaking out from it. The primary trend has been bullish, with higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily chart. The stock has been bullish, being placed above short to medium-term moving averages. The power sector has been in a bullish momentum phase on short to medium-term charts.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,650    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,391    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    JK Cement | CMP: Rs 4,932.4        JK Cement has been trading between its upward sloping trendline for more than two years. Recently, prices found support at this trendline and reversed to the upside. Prices have gained more than 20% since March 17, which indicates strength in the ongoing trend. Additionally, for the past three consecutive trading sessions, prices have managed to protect their prior day\u2019s low, suggesting that bulls are still in control of the trend.    Moreover, prices have closed above its swing high near Rs 5,000, and with follow-up buying, we can expect prices to reach new fresh highs. The ADX (Average Directional Index) reading of 29 suggests positive momentum to continue in the asset. In summary, the current trend for JK Cement is positive. A break above the Rs 5,000 level can lead to a trending move towards Rs 5,180, followed by Rs 5,410. On the downside, Rs 4,830 is the nearest support to watch out for.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,180, Rs 5,410    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,830    Trent | CMP: Rs 5,576.75        In the previous session, Trent managed to gain 4.7% despite major indices falling, which is a strong bullish sign. Moreover, the price has completed its journey towards the upper Bollinger Bands after reversing from the lower bands and is now breaking above the upper bands, giving strong positive confirmation that the daily trend is in favour of the bulls.    The RSI at 61 levels gives prices the space to trend further. In summary, the current trend for Trent is bullish. A break above Rs 5,620 can lead to a trading move towards Rs 5,850 or higher. On the downside, Rs 5,400 is the nearest support.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,850    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,400    Authum Investment &amp;amp; Infrastucture | CMP: Rs 1,778.5        Over the past three sessions, Authum Investment prices have protected their prior day\u2019s low on a closing basis, which suggests that the daily bias is likely to remain on the side of the bulls. Currently, prices are witnessing a rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart. A break above Rs 1,800 can lead to a trending move towards the neckline at Rs 1,860 and higher. Additionally, the MACD has recently witnessed a bullish crossover and has breached above its zero line, further supporting the bullish stance.    In summary, the current trend for Authum Investment is bullish. A break above Rs 1,800 can lead to a trending move towards Rs 1,860, followed by Rs 1,950. On the downside, Rs 1,740 is the nearest support.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,860, Rs 1,950    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,740    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmark indices closed moderately lower amid a lacklustre session, while the broader markets were hit hard, with market breadth strongly dominated by bears. About 2,103 shares declined, compared to 505 advancing shares on the NSE. The market may consolidate further with a negative bias. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at Samco Securities    Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,493.5        Eicher Motors has finally broken out of a horizontal channel that had been intact for several weeks. The stock decisively moved higher in Thursday\u2019s session with the highest volume seen in over a month, signaling renewed buying interest.    This breakout comes after a prolonged consolidation phase, with the stock now trading above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The RSI has sharply risen to 59, turning upward from a flat range and indicating that momentum is picking up. Meanwhile, the MACD has just flipped into positive territory, with the fast and slow lines converging and the histogram moving back above the neutral line\u2014a sign of early strength.    The previous resistance near Rs 5,400 has now turned into immediate support, while the broader base around Rs 5,280 remains a strong floor for the near term. Sustaining above Rs 5,520, a move toward higher levels looks probable. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position in Eicher Motors at the current market price (CMP).    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,850    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,340    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1,877        After weeks of rangebound movement, Bharti Airtel is showing strength as it inches closer to the upper end of its consolidation zone. The stock is now hovering just below the key Rs 1,890 resistance level that has capped recent attempts to move higher.    The stock remains above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages, with the price displaying a gradual upward bias. The RSI has improved to 57, reflecting growing momentum, while the MACD is on the verge of a bullish crossover. The volume has remained modest but steady, and the hourly chart reflects a positive outlook. A decisive close above Rs 1,890 could mark a short-term breakout and unlock further upside.    Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position in Bharti Airtel at the CMP.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,950    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,842    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,088.3        Tata Consumer Products is showing signs of a bullish reversal from a major support zone. The recent formation of a Morning Star pattern on the daily chart signals a potential trend reversal. This is further supported by rising trading volumes, indicating renewed buying interest and strengthening sentiment around the stock.    The stock has immediate support around the Rs 1,060 level, which can be considered a strong accumulation zone for investors looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 44.38 and is trending upwards, reflecting increasing bullish momentum. This shift suggests that the recent downside pressure may be easing, and buyers are gradually gaining control.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,200, Rs 1,220    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030    Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,094.8        M&amp;amp;M has been consolidating in a narrow range and is now showing signs of strength as it approaches a breakout. The stock is forming a flag and pole pattern on the daily chart, which is typically a bullish continuation pattern. Rising trading volumes are indicating increasing investor interest and support the likelihood of a breakout in the short term.    A close above the key resistance level of Rs 3,100 would confirm the breakout and further strengthen the bullish momentum. The RSI is at 57.60, suggesting positive momentum while still offering room for further upside. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 3,040, which could act as a good entry point for traders looking to buy on dips.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,400, Rs 3,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,930    JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 996        JSW Steel has recently formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, which typically indicates a consolidation phase before a significant move. The rising volume accompanying this pattern suggests growing interest and the potential for a trend reversal. The stock is now nearing a breakout point, signaling the emergence of strong bullish momentum in both the short and long term.    A decisive close above the Rs 1,005 level will act as confirmation of the breakout, likely reinforcing the uptrend and paving the way for further gains. The RSI is currently at 49.45, pointing to gradually building positive momentum while still leaving room for further upside. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 980, which can be seen as an attractive level for buying on dips.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,100, Rs 1,150    Stop-Loss: Rs 950    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    Wipro | CMP: Rs 265.6        Wipro has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart, a formation that typically signals bullish continuation. The breakout is supported by the stock moving above its 100-day exponential moving average, suggesting strengthening momentum. Moreover, the MACD indicator is on a rising trajectory, adding further confirmation to the positive price action.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 282    Stop-Loss: Rs 258    Oil and Natural Gas Corporation | CMP: Rs 251.55        ONGC is currently retesting its breakout from a symmetrical triangle formation on the daily chart. The price action has shown resilience, with the formation of a bullish Hammer candlestick, which suggests renewed buying interest at lower levels. Additionally, the MACD remains positively aligned, supporting the case for further upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 260    Stop-Loss: Rs 245    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices recorded a consolidation breakout with a massive sell-off on February 28, losing nearly 2 percent, with market breadth consistently favouring bears. About 2,278 shares declined compared to 346 rising shares on the NSE. The rebound after a severe fall can't be ruled out, but the sustainability is key to watch. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    Bharat Heavy Electricals | CMP: Rs 179.17        BHEL is trending lower, forming a series of lower tops and bottoms on the daily and weekly charts, signaling a sustained downtrend. With the current close, the stock has decisively broken down its past one-month support zone of Rs 184 on a closing basis, which signals a bearish bias. The stock is sustaining below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms further weakness. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in negative territory, indicating rising weakness. Investors/traders should sell or exit this stock, with an expected downside of Rs 165-145, and its upside resistance zone is Rs 190-200.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 165, Rs 145    Stop-Loss: Rs 190    UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 10,128.5        Since June 2024, UltraTech Cement has been consolidating within a broad range (Rs 12,100-10,500), indicating a sideways trend. However, with Friday's sell-off, the stock decisively broke down its multiple support zone of Rs 10,500 on a closing basis, signaling a change of trend towards the downside. The stock is sustaining below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms further weakness.    The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in negative territory, indicating rising weakness. The daily and weekly &quot;Bollinger bands&quot; sell signal suggests increased momentum. Investors/traders should sell or exit this stock, with an expected downside of Rs 9,700-9,500 and an upside resistance zone of Rs 10,500-10,800.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 9,700, Rs 9,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 10,500    Ipca Laboratories | CMP: Rs 1,355.35        Recently, Ipca Laboratories has confirmed a downtrend, forming a series of lower tops and bottoms on the daily chart. It has also violated the past four weeks' multiple support zone of Rs 1,380 on a closing basis, indicating further weakness. The stock is sustaining below its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which reconfirms further weakness. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicator RSI is in negative territory, indicating rising weakness. The daily and weekly &quot;Bollinger bands&quot; sell signal suggests increased momentum. Investors/traders should sell or exit this stock, with an expected downside of Rs 1,250-1,175 and an upside resistance zone of Rs 1,425-1,460.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,175    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,425    Ameya Ranadive, CMT, CFTe, Senior Technical Analyst at Stoxbox    BSE | CMP: Rs 4,633.7        BSE fell over 10% on Friday, reinforcing a strong bearish momentum. The stock has broken below the crucial support of Rs 5,050, confirming a sell-on-rise strategy. Any rebound toward Rs 4,800 can be used as a shorting opportunity, with downside targets placed at Rs 4,200 and Rs 4,100. The RSI at 36 indicates weak momentum, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) signals an intensifying bearish trend. Additionally, price rejection near Rs 5,100 suggests that buyers are failing to absorb the selling pressure, keeping the sentiment negative.    As long as BSE trades below Rs 5,100, the broader trend remains weak, favouring a bearish stance. Traders should look for sustained lower highs and failed intraday recoveries as confirmation of further downside. A decisive breakout above Rs 5,100 would invalidate this view, but until then, selling on rallies remains the preferred approach.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 4,200, Rs 4,100    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,800    Granules India | CMP: Rs 461.8        Granules India declined nearly 9% on Friday. The stock has decisively breached the key support zone of Rs 505-500, confirming a sell-on-rise strategy. Any pullback toward Rs 480 can be used as a shorting opportunity, with downside targets placed at Rs 435 and Rs 420. The RSI at 28 signals oversold conditions; however, the lack of reversal signs suggests that weakness could persist. The ADX indicates a strengthening bearish trend, while repeated price rejection from the Rs 529-Rs 535 resistance zone reinforces the negative sentiment.    Despite the oversold RSI, caution is warranted as stocks in strong downtrends often remain oversold for an extended period. A sustained move above Rs 510 would negate this bearish view, but as long as the stock remains below this level, the overall structure remains weak.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 435, Rs 420    Stop-Loss: Rs 480    LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 496.9        LIC Housing Finance continues to trend lower within a well-defined falling channel, indicating sustained bearish momentum. The stock has witnessed strong selling pressure over the last three sessions, supported by high volumes, reinforcing the weakness. Additionally, it is trading below all key exponential moving averages (10, 50, 100, and 200-EMA), further strengthening the bearish outlook. Any pullback toward Rs 505 can be utilized as a shorting opportunity, with downside targets placed at Rs 477 and Rs 470. The RSI at 29.51 suggests oversold conditions, but the absence of reversal signals indicates that the weakness is likely to persist.    The ADX confirms a strengthening bearish trend, while repeated price rejection from the Rs 517-Rs 526 resistance zone suggests that sellers remain in control. Despite the oversold RSI, a reversal is unlikely unless the stock decisively moves above Rs 520, which would negate the bearish outlook. Until then, the broader trend remains weak, favouring a sell-on-rise approach.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 477, Rs 470    Stop-Loss: Rs 505    Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One    Coal India | CMP: Rs 369.35        Coal India has been on a stellar down run, eroding nearly 30 percent from its peak of Rs 517. Currently, the counter is hovering near the 20 DEMA, portraying a consolidation phase. However, in the shorter duration, the counter has been witnessing some buying traction and seems to have a counter-trend with a supportive bullish trend indicated by the SuperTrend indicator. Also, the 14-period RSI and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) align well with the undertone, adding a bullish quotient. Hence, we recommend buying Coal India around Rs 360-355.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 400    Stop-Loss: Rs 340    HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,732.4        HDFC Bank has seen a decent recovery from the 200 DSMA and is now placed above the short-term EMAs on the daily chart. The recent buying traction has been backed by a rise in trading volumes, attributing to positive development in the counter. Additionally, the counter is comfortably placed above the SuperTrend indicator, adding to its bullish quotient. Simultaneously, the MACD indicator has surged to the zero line from lower levels, suggesting potential momentum in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying HDFC Bank around Rs 1,730-Rs 1,720.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,850    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,630    SRF | CMP: Rs 2,795.40        SRF has experienced a significant bull run from the zone of Rs 2,200 in the last couple of trading months and has witnessed a multi-week breakout of the Rs 2,700 subzone. The counter is placed above all its significant EMAs on the daily time frame structure, suggesting inherent strength, and is anticipated to continue the same in the near term. The neckline of the breakout is likely to provide a cushion, while the stock seems likely to enter uncharted territory in the upcoming period. Hence, we recommend buying SRF around Rs 2,750-Rs 2,730.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "Geojit Financial Services research report on SBI Life Insurance Company  SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd, a leading life insurance company in India, was incorporated in October 2000. It offers individual and group insurance plans, covering life and health, and annuity, pension and variable products. It also has unit-linked plans. In Q4FY25, net premium income declined 5.0% YoY to Rs. 23,861cr, driven by a substantial 42.1% YoY reduction in single premium income to Rs. 4,463cr. In FY25, new business premium (NBP) stood at Rs. 35,580cr, with a private market share of 20.8%. Individual NBP reached Rs. 26,360cr, reflecting an increase of 11% YoY and a private market share of 25.3% driven by growing demand for individual life insurance products. In FY25, gross written premium came in at Rs. 84,980cr, up 4% YoY, driven by consistency in policy renewals and moderate growth in both new and existing business. In FY25, VoNB rose 7.2% YoY to Rs. 5,950cr, with VoNBV margin at 27.8% (vs 28.1% in FY24), driven by volume growth, though partially offset by a slight shift in the product mix towards lower-margin offerings. Profit after tax (PAT) slightly increased 0.3% YoY to Rs. 814cr in Q4FY25, driven by operational efficiencies.  Outlook  Therefore, we maintain our BUY rating on the stock, based on 2x FY27E EV, with a revised target price of Rs. 2,048.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Telecom major Bharti Airtel Ltd on August 5 reported 43% jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,948 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, marking its fifth straight quarter of profit growth.    However, the firm missed profit estimates as the Moneycontrol poll of brokerages pegged the bottom line at Rs 8,169 crore. On a sequential basis, the net profit declined 46%.    Airtel\u2019s revenue from operations rose 28% year-on-year to Rs 49,463 crore in the June quarter (Q1FY26), up from Rs 38,506 crore a year earlier. On the NSE, Airtel shares closed 0.8% higher at Rs 1,930 apiece ahead of the results.    The company\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) climbed to Rs 250 in Q1FY26 from Rs 211 in the year-ago quarter. Its total customer base grew 6.6% year-on-year to 436 million.    Consolidated EBITDA rose 41.2% to Rs 28,167 crore, with a consolidated EBITDA margin of 56.9% and India EBITDA margin of 59.5%. Consolidated EBIT also jumped 67% to Rs 15,621 crore. Net income before exceptional items stood at Rs 5,948 crore.    \u201cWe delivered another quarter of consistent growth, with consolidated revenues at Rs 49,463 crore, growing 3.3% sequentially. Our India revenue increased by 2.3%, while Africa delivered solid performance with 6.7% constant currency growth,\u201d said Gopal Vittal, Vice-Chairman and MD, Bharti Airtel.    He added that the India mobile business grew 2.9% sequentially, led by portfolio premiumisation and the benefit of an extra day in the quarter. \u201cOur balance sheet continues to demonstrate strength, supported by solid cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation,\u201d Vittal said.    Airtel\u2019s smartphone data user base rose by 21.3 million year-on-year and 3.9 million sequentially, now accounting for 77% of the overall mobile customer base. The company added 0.7 million postpaid users during the quarter, taking the segment base to 26.6 million. Mobile data consumption rose 21.6% annually, with per-user monthly usage averaging 26.9 GB.    To bolster network performance, Airtel added ~1,800 new towers and ~7,500 mobile broadband sites during the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, it installed ~15,400 towers and laid 43,700 km of fiber.    Its Homes business maintained strong growth momentum, registering a 25.7% YoY increase in revenue. Airtel added a record 939,000 Wi-Fi customers during the quarter, taking the total home broadband user base to 11 million. The company also expanded its home-pass network by ~1.6 million fibre connections in the quarter.    \u201cOur Homes business reported solid performance with lifetime-high quarterly net additions of 939K, resulting in sequential revenue growth of 7.6%. Our digital network across India and Africa now serves over 600 million customers,\u201d Vittal noted.    On the enterprise front, Airtel Business revenue declined 7.7% YoY as the company shifted focus to high-quality revenue and exited low-margin contracts. However, the underlying momentum from core connectivity and digital services remained stable, the company said.    The Digital TV segment reported Rs 763 crore in revenue with a customer base of 15.7 million. Airtel\u2019s new IPTV service, launched last quarter, continued to gain traction, adding 0.65 million users in the June quarter.",

        "Description": "Brokerages remain bullish on ITC despite margin pressures, citing strong cigarette volume growth and improving FMCG performance.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd shares traded in the green on August 4, after the tobacco giant reported flat profit growth for the quarter ended June.    ITC reported its standalone net profit was flat at Rs 4,912 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, as elevated input costs continued to pressure margins. The company reported net profit of Rs Rs 4,917 crore in the same quarter last year.    However, the conglomerate's revenue rose 20 per cent  to Rs 21,059 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 17,593 crore a year ago, driven by strong sales from cigarettes, agri business and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses.    Cigarette revenue was up 8 percent, supported by a stable tax environment and market interventions. However, margins are under pressure due to high-cost leaf tobacco, and this trend may continue into FY26. While the FMCG segment showed improved growth, the paperboard segment remained under pressure.    The FMCG-to-cigarettes conglomerate said it expects lower inflation, reduction in interest rates &amp;amp; liquidity support by RBI and  tax cuts along with front loading of government expenditure to &quot;bolster the growth momentum going forward&quot;.    At 9.25 a.m., shares of ITC were quoting Rs 419.15, higher by 0.65 percent on the NSE.    Should you buy, sell, or hold ITC shares?    International brokerage Morgan Stanley maintained its 'overweight' call with a price target of Rs 500 per share, noting that the beat in the revenue was driven by ITC's agri business.    &amp;nbsp;    Citi has a 'buy' rating, while Macquarie reiterated an 'outperform' rating on ITC, both issuing a target price of Rs 500. The brokerages noted that cigarette growth remained strong, and margins are expected to recover in the second half.    FMCG growth is improving, and a similar margin recovery is likely in the latter half of the year. Although margins in the paper business weakened, they may have bottomed. Earnings growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of FY27, noted Citi.    Jefferies retained a 'buy' rating and sets a target price of Rs 535 per share. Cigarette volume growth accelerated to a multi-quarter high, although segment EBIT margins continued to decline. EBIT was in line, but other segments reported lower-than-expected earnings due to margin pressure. Overall EBITDA growth remained muted at 3 percent.    According to Emkay Global, looking ahead, the brokerage expects a gradual improvement in cigarette performance, driven by improved execution and a catch-up in volume growth relative to the industry\u2014containing market share loss will be key.    &quot;That said, a near-term overhang persists due to potential cigarette tax increases linked to the replacement of the compensation cess,&quot; said Emkay.

The brokerage highlighted a strong Q1FY26 performance, with VNB (Value of New Business) margin improving by 60 basis points year-on-year to 27.4 percent.    This margin expansion was driven by a shift in the product mix away from ULIPs.

        "Date": "2025-07-29",
        "Description": "The market may continue to consolidate with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmarks started off the monthly F&amp;amp;O expiry week on a negative note, with the Nifty 50 declining 0.63 percent, extending its downward journey for the third straight session on July 28. The market breadth continued to be dominated by bears, with 2,043 shares declining compared to 673 advancing on the NSE. The market may continue to consolidate with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    TCS | CMP: Rs 3,079.3        Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has been on a downward trajectory since mid-May 2025, consistently forming lower highs and lower lows. This bearish structure has led to a correction of nearly Rs 440, a decline of approximately 12.32 percent. However, the stock now stands at a technically significant zone, where both time and price confluence suggest a potential trend reversal.    Historically, key pivot highs and lows in TCS have often occurred within a 25\u201338-day cycle. Notably, this time window aligns with both a Lucas number (29) and a Fibonacci number (34), adding further credibility to the time-based support.    Additionally, a bullish Bat Harmonic Pattern is forming around the Rs 3,080\u20133,100 mark, coinciding with the S1 quarterly floor pivot, reinforcing the likelihood of a strong base. The MACD histogram is also showing signs of waning negative momentum, with shrinking red bars indicating a possible trend shift. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 3,100\u20133,070 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,335    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,960    Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | CMP: Rs 1,702.2        Sun Pharma has established a strong support base in the Rs 1,650\u20131,680 range, which aligns with the S3 Camarilla monthly pivot, marking a critical support zone. This area is further reinforced by a rising trendline and the lower median line of a pitchfork, forming a powerful technical confluence likely to attract renewed buying interest. The convergence of these multiple support levels enhances the likelihood of a bullish reversal. A decisive breakout above this consolidation zone could trigger a new upward movement. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,705\u20131,695 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650    Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,572        Cipla has successfully breached its descending trendline on the weekly chart, accompanied by a notable surge in volume, signaling a potential trend reversal. The RSI on the weekly timeframe remains in the 45\u201350 range, which typically suggests building bullish momentum. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,575\u20131,565 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,670    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,520    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Torrent Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 3,622.9        Torrent Pharma has given a clean breakout from its consolidation and has since been forming higher highs and higher lows. The rising Open Interest suggests long buildup, indicating a positive trend in the short to medium term.    Options activity shows strong Put writing across strikes from Rs 3,400 to Rs 3,600, while Call writers appear trapped at Rs 3,350 to Rs 3,400. This setup could cause short-term volatility, but any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity. Buy Torrent Pharma August Futures in the range of Rs 3,660 to Rs 3,630.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,770, Rs 3,830    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,530    NCC | CMP: Rs 215.51        NCC has broken multiple support levels in the Rs 218\u2013220 range, accompanied by a rise in Open Interest, indicating short buildup and suggesting further downside pressure in the near term.    Since being introduced in the derivatives market, NCC has consistently witnessed short additions, and the recent breakdown adds further confirmation of the next leg of a downtrend. The stock faces a strong hurdle at Rs 230, where the highest Call open interest is placed. It is also trading below its maximum pain level and the 20-day VWAP, currently at Rs 225 and Rs 223, respectively. So, sell NCC August Futures in the range of Rs 220 to Rs 212, with a negative short-term outlook unless it closes above its key hurdles.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 204, Rs 200    Stop-Loss: Rs 225    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    One 97 Communications | CMP: Rs 1,094.2        Paytm has been in a positive trend since May 2024. In the recent week, it broke out of a cup-and-handle formation, following the prior week\u2019s breakout above the December 2024 swing high, both supported by a volume surge above the 20-week average, confirming strong participation.  On the daily chart, the stock has shown resilience amid broader market volatility, holding steady near its 5-day EMA, with the 12- and 26-day EMAs rising, reflecting a strong underlying trend. The MACD remains in a rising trajectory, indicating sustained bullish momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,225    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,039    SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,850.5        SBI Life remains in a strong long-term uptrend, forming higher bottoms on the monthly chart since 2018.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices closed with gains of one-tenth of a percent amid rangebound trading on July 1. The market breadth was largely neutral, with around 1,327 shares witnessing selling pressure versus 1,314 shares that gained on the NSE. The frontline indices are expected to see further consolidation in upcoming sessions before potentially entering a new leg of the uptrend. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    SBI Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,862.5        After a remarkable up move in recent weeks, SBI Life Insurance has entered a consolidation phase near its resistance zone. Despite this, the stock closed comfortably above its short-term moving average. Additionally, the closing near its resistance zone on the daily chart suggests a bullish continuation chart structure, indicating that the uptrend may persist. Rs 1,790 could be the trend-deciding level for bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, a further uptrend toward Rs 1,990 is likely.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,990    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,790    Jindal Steel &amp;amp; Power | CMP: Rs 951.3        Jindal Steel &amp;amp; Power has shown a robust rally from lower levels in recent sessions. Following this upward movement, the stock has formed a consolidation structure, suggesting a bullish continuation pattern. Moreover, it has closed above its short-term moving average. For positional traders, Rs 915 is decisive. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend may continue towards Rs 1,020. A close below Rs 915, however, may prompt traders to exit long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,020    Stop-Loss: Rs 915    Cipla | CMP: Rs 1,515.7        Following a strong uptrend, Cipla is currently trading within a symmetrical triangle chart pattern on the daily scale, which suggests continued bullish momentum in the short term. Additionally, the stock has formed a higher bottom on the weekly chart, indicating strength and potential for a fresh breakout.    As long as the stock remains above Rs 1,475, the bullish structure is likely to continue, with an upside target of Rs 1,590.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,590    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,475    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    Federal Bank | CMP: Rs 218.72        Federal Bank is outperforming within the private sector banking space. In the previous session, the stock gave a breakout from a rounding bottom pattern, closing above the neckline at Rs 217 and reaching a new lifetime high of Rs 219.45. Over the past eight trading sessions, the stock has consistently protected its prior candle\u2019s low, indicating sustained buying interest.    Additionally, Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand, suggesting that strong momentum may continue. The MACD has also shown a bullish crossover, confirming a positive outlook. Post a sharp rally, buying on dips appears to be a prudent approach.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 230    Stop-Loss: Rs 210    Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation | CMP: Rs 420.35        GMDC is forming higher highs and higher lows, indicating a bullish structure. Since June 20, the stock has consistently held above its prior day\u2019s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign. Throughout the rally that began in May 2025, prices have held above the mid-Bollinger band, making it an important support level. The mid-band support lies at Rs 401.    Currently trading near the upper band, a decisive breakout above Rs 430 could extend the rally toward Rs 451, followed by Rs 465. The ADX indicator is at 34 (above 25), confirming strong positive momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 451, Rs 465    Stop-Loss: Rs 409    CESC | CMP: Rs 176.45        In the previous session, CESC closed above its prior day\u2019s high with a notable increase in volume\u2014an encouraging sign. The stock recently dipped toward the Ichimoku cloud and channel support, then rebounded sharply, rallying more than 9% in a short span\u2014suggesting bulls are regaining control.    The stock is currently near its previous swing high around Rs 177. A decisive breakout above this level could trigger further bullish momentum toward Rs 184, followed by Rs 191. The RSI remains moderate, suggesting room for further upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 184, Rs 191    Stop-Loss: Rs 170    Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities    Jubilant Foodworks | CMP: Rs 709.75        Jubilant Foodworks has been in a sustainable uptrend over the past few weeks, forming a bullish pattern of higher tops and bottoms. The stock is now attempting a decisive breakout above a downward-sloping trendline in the Rs 700\u2013710 zone. Both volume patterns and daily/weekly RSI indicators suggest a positive outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 780    Stop-Loss: Rs 670    Carborundum Universal | CMP: Rs 997.15        The stock seems to have ended its recent downtrend after forming a strong bottom reversal at Rs 915. It is now showing a sustainable bounce and is attempting an upside breakout above the descending trendline at Rs 985, as seen on the weekly chart. Volume and RSI patterns indicate additional upside potential. The overall chart structure signals a long trading opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,105    Stop-Loss: Rs 940    Kolte-Patil Developers | CMP: Rs 492.4        After several weeks of narrow-range trading, Kolte Patil Developers witnessed a decisive upside breakout on Tuesday and closed higher. The stock is forming a broader bullish pattern of higher tops and bottoms on the weekly chart. It recently rebounded from the immediate support of the 10-day EMA.    Volume expansion during the breakout, coupled with positive signals from both daily and weekly RSI indicators, suggests continued upside potential.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 543    Stop-Loss: Rs 468    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmarks clocked a 1.21 percent rally on June 26, continuing their uptrend for the third consecutive day. However, the market breadth did not entirely reflect this optimism and was only slightly in favour of the bulls. About 1,337 shares saw buying interest, compared to 1,263 shares that declined on the NSE. Momentum is expected to drive the rally further in the equity markets. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 2,053.6        Bajaj Finserv is showing signs of a bullish breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, signalling a potential trend reversal. This view is further supported by increasing trading volumes, indicating growing participation.    The stock has immediate support around Rs 2,015, which can be considered a strong accumulation zone for investors looking to enter on dips. The RSI stands at 58.63 and is trending upwards, reflecting increasing bullish momentum. Given these technical signals, Bajaj Finserv appears poised for an upward move.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,280, Rs 2,300    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,950    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 647.3        ICICI Prudential is currently consolidating within a narrow range, forming a bullish flag and pole pattern on the daily chart. The strong volume observed during this phase suggests accumulation and enhances the probability of an upward breakout. A decisive close above the key resistance at Rs 650 would confirm the breakout and strengthen bullish momentum.    The RSI is at 58.57, indicating positive sentiment with room for additional upside. Importantly, the stock has also given a golden crossover across key moving averages\u201420, 50, 100, and 200 EMA\u2014signalling a strong bullish trend and potential continuation. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 640, making it a favourable entry level for dip buyers.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 700, Rs 730    Stop-Loss: Rs 620    LIC Housing Finance | CMP: Rs 662        LIC Housing Finance has recently formed a Rectangle pattern on the daily chart, typically signalling a consolidation phase before a significant move. The rising volume during this formation suggests growing interest and the potential for a trend reversal.    A decisive close above Rs 625 will confirm the breakout, likely reinforcing the uptrend and paving the way for further gains. The RSI is at 59.01, pointing to gradually building positive momentum while still leaving room for additional upside. On the downside, immediate support lies at Rs 600, which can be seen as an attractive level for buying on dips.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 700, Rs 720    Stop-Loss: Rs 585    Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities    FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 206.85        Nykaa has been gradually gaining momentum after a period of sideways consolidation and is now approaching a key resistance near Rs 208. The stock has recently formed a double bottom pattern, which now acts as strong support. This bullish reversal pattern is supported by a higher low formation and a consistent optimistic outlook.    The price is currently trading above the Supertrend level and the short-term moving averages, indicating a positive undertone. The RSI stands at 61 with a rising slope, suggesting healthy momentum without signs of exhaustion. The MACD has turned bullish, with a fresh crossover and the histogram back in green territory\u2014reflecting improving participation. Volume activity remains stable, and a breakout above Rs 208 could trigger further upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 218    Stop-Loss: Rs 198    Avenue Supermarts | CMP: Rs 4,315.4        DMart has resumed its upward momentum after consolidating in a narrow range just above the key resistance zone near Rs 4,250. The stock is forming a tight bullish continuation pattern, resembling a flag or narrow base breakout, and is showing resilience after reclaiming short-term moving averages. It is now trading well above the 50-day simple moving average, placed at Rs 4,150, while the previous resistance zone has flipped into support.    The broader trend remains intact, with the price forming a sequence of higher lows. The RSI stands at 60 and continues to inch higher with a steady slope. The MACD shows a clean bullish crossover, with the fast line moving well above the signal line and the histogram expanding on the positive side. Volume activity has picked up modestly over the last few sessions as well.    A decisive move above the immediate swing high at Rs 4,360 could lead to a fresh leg higher. The current consolidation appears constructive and may serve as a springboard for the next move.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,190    Kajaria Ceramics | CMP: Rs 1,118.80        Kajaria Ceramics has shown a decisive trend reversal after a prolonged downtrend and is now trading firmly above its 20-day and 50-day EMAs. The recent breakout above the Rs 1,100 zone marks a strong shift in momentum, as the stock also attempts to reclaim levels near its 200-day SMA for the first time in several months. The price structure reflects sustained buying interest with higher highs and higher lows over the last few weeks.    The RSI has surged above 70, indicating strong momentum, while the MACD remains in a positive crossover with widening divergence, suggesting further strength in the uptrend. Volume has picked up consistently through the recent rally, confirming accumulation. In the broader time frame, the prior congestion zone around Rs 1,025\u20131,050 now acts as a strong base, and a close above the 200-day SMA could invite fresh participation.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,220    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,070    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    Reliance Industries | CMP: Rs 1,495.3        Reliance has broken out of a classic pole and flag pattern on the daily chart, supported by a large-bodied bullish candle and higher-than-average volumes\u2014both signalling strong follow-through buying interest. The rising RSI further confirms strengthening bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,440    Max Healthcare Institute | CMP: Rs 1,266.5        Max Healthcare has given a decisive range breakout near its all-time high zones, highlighting bullish intent. The stock continues to respect its 50-day exponential moving average (50 DEMA), with minor dips attracting buyers. A rising MACD supports the ongoing momentum and indicates further upside potential.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,350    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,230    Jio Financial Services | CMP: Rs 312.5        Jio Financial remains in a firm uptrend, consistently respecting its 20-day exponential moving average (20 DEMA) as dynamic support. Notably, a bullish Marubozu candle has formed on the weekly chart, reinforcing strong sentiment. A bullish MACD crossover on the daily chart further strengthens the bullish case.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 335    Stop-Loss: Rs 300    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices closed nearly 0.4 percent lower on July 31 following a Trump tariff-led volatile session. Bears dominated market breadth as about 1,786 shares declined, compared to 872 that gained on the NSE. The bearish sentiment is expected to prevail until the frontline indices provide a sustainable close above the medium-term moving average. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services    Bayer Cropscience | CMP: Rs 6,322.5        Bayer Cropscience is currently forming a pennant pattern and is supported by the 20-day EMA following a breakout above the trendline resistance. The price action is displaying multiple Spinning Top and Doji candlestick patterns, indicating market indecision. A breakout above Rs 6,512 could target levels of Rs 7,200 and Rs 7,600, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,130 post-breakout. Additionally, a golden crossover at the start of the month supports a bullish outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 7,200, Rs 7,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 6,130    Ajanta Pharma | CMP: Rs 2,751.4        Ajanta Pharma has broken out above a descending triangle pattern, supported by strong volume activity. A golden crossover was observed on Wednesday, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The price is currently finding support near its 20-EMA. A breakout above the resistance zone of Rs 2,850\u20132,862 could trigger a bullish move, potentially pushing the price toward Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,100.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,000, Rs 3,100    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,580    Mandar Bhojane, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Jindal Stainless | CMP: Rs 694.1        Jindal Stainless is displaying a strong bullish setup, with technical indicators aligning across multiple timeframes. On the daily chart, the stock is nearing a breakout from a descending triangle pattern, which typically signals accumulation and reduced selling pressure. A decisive close above Rs 700 with strong volumes would validate the breakout and could lead to a sharp upward rally.    The stock is trading comfortably above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, indicating sustained strength across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The RSI is at 58.21, steadily rising and showing strong buying interest without being overbought. Momentum remains favourable, with a positive MACD bias, further supporting the bullish structure. Traders may consider a buy-on-dips strategy near Rs 675.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 777    Stop-Loss: Rs 655    NLC India | CMP: Rs 242.25        NLC India is consolidating near a key breakout zone, reflecting underlying strength. On the daily chart, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic bullish continuation setup. Rising volumes during this consolidation phase indicate growing investor interest, increasing the probability of an upside breakout.    A decisive close above Rs 245 would confirm the breakout and could ignite strong bullish momentum. The RSI is at 57.85 and trending upward, signaling healthy momentum. On the downside, Rs 235 acts as immediate support and can be considered a buy-on-dips zone for positional traders.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 267    Stop-Loss: Rs 230    General Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 392.15        General Insurance Corporation of India is on the verge of a breakout from a falling trendline and a descending triangle pattern on the daily chart. This technical setup, along with rising volumes, reflects renewed buying interest and a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls.    From a momentum perspective, the RSI stands at 57.76, trending upward and showing bullish divergence, further supporting the strengthening momentum. On the downside, Rs 382 serves as a strong support level, making it a key accumulation zone for traders. If the stock sustains above current levels with continued volume participation, it could move toward a short-term target of Rs 440.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 440    Stop-Loss: Rs 369    Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities    Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,512.20        Hindustan Unilever decisively broke out of a downward-sloping flag pattern on the daily chart. This bullish continuation pattern emerged after a sharp recovery from the Rs 2,400 level. Thursday\u2019s breakout was backed by a notable rise in volume, confirming strong follow-through momentum.    The stock reclaimed the Rs 2,510 horizontal resistance, which had capped gains in a previous breakout attempt. The candle structure shows a wide bullish body with a close near the day\u2019s high, indicating strong institutional buying and no signs of upper wick exhaustion.    The daily RSI rebounded sharply from the 50 level and is now near 64, climbing above its signal line and hinting at improving bullish momentum. The surge in volume adds further credibility to the breakout. The flag breakout, along with a rebound in the FMCG sector, suggests potential short-term upside. The Rs 2,470\u20132,480 zone can be considered for accumulation on any pullback.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,640    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,460    JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,048.3        JSW Steel is breaking out above a rising triangle formation on the daily chart after facing multiple rejections near the Rs 1,045 zone. The stock has consistently formed higher lows since March, with the trendline now acting as a critical support\u2014underlining the bullish setup.    The breakout candle is accompanied by a noticeable increase in volume and has closed near the day\u2019s high, indicating sustained strength. The RSI has risen sharply to 65, crossing above its signal line and confirming strengthening momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD is nearing a bullish crossover.    The stock has formed a solid base in the Rs 1,030\u20131,035 range, and with the current breakout above Rs 1,045, the bullish trend is likely to extend further.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,095    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025    Bharti Hexacom | CMP: Rs 1,847.70        Bharti Hexacom has regained strength, staging a breakout after forming a double bottom base near the Rs 1,750 zone. The pattern had been developing over the past few weeks within a defined rectangle range, and Thursday\u2019s move confirms a bullish reversal from recent consolidation.    The stock reclaimed the 20-EMA and crossed above the upper horizontal resistance near Rs 1,840, which had capped multiple intraday rallies. The breakout candle closed near the day\u2019s high with above-average volume, indicating renewed strength.    The RSI has rebounded to 56, validating the breakout with improving momentum. The price is also trending above the 50-SMA, which is expected to act as immediate support on any dip. The daily Supertrend indicator also supports the bullish bias. Any pullback toward the Rs 1,820 zone would present a good accumulation opportunity.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices were caught in a bear trap with the Nifty 50 falling 1.5% on April 4 after retaliation by China, imposing a 34% tariff on US products. The market breadth was strongly in favour of declines, with about 2,159 shares seeing correction compared to 430 rising shares on the NSE. The market is expected to see more weakness in the upcoming sessions, given the dismal global cues. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One    Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,165        Max Financial Services (MFSL) has registered a bullish breakout from multiple chart patterns. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,160, confirming a rounding bottom breakout. Following a strong rally from the Rs 1,050 zone and a brief consolidation phase, we are now witnessing a Flag pattern breakout, indicating a strong trend resumption. Both breakouts are backed by healthy volumes and a favourable setup across key indicators. We expect this positive momentum to continue in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying MFSL around Rs 1,165 - Rs 1,155.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,265    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,115    Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,087.85        Tata Consumer delivered strong performance despite weakness in the broader market during the last week. The stock has closed above its February swing high of Rs 1,075, establishing a higher top\u2013higher bottom structure, which indicates the continuation of a bullish price cycle. On both the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed strong bullish candles and closed above all major moving averages, reinforcing the positive momentum. Hence, we recommend buying Tata Consumer Products around Rs 1,088 - Rs 1,080.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,150    Stop-loss: Rs 1,048    Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities    CG Power and Industrial Solutions | CMP: Rs 575.2        CG Power has touched its trendline support mark of Rs 580 on its daily charts. With the RSI (14) around 37, the stock is showing slightly oversold conditions. An ADX (Average Directional Index) of approximately 21 indicates low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors buyers with limited downside risk from current levels. Additionally, the stock touched its major support level of Rs 570 during Friday\u2019s trading session. We recommend buying the stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 625, Rs 650    Stop-Loss: Rs 555    MCX India | CMP: Rs 5,026.8        MCX India broke down below its immediate support mark of Rs 5,077 and closed below that level. With the RSI (14) around 44, the stock indicates neutral conditions. An ADX of around 18 suggests low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors sellers at current levels. Furthermore, the stock broke below its 20-period simple moving average during Friday\u2019s session, which is a negative sign. We recommend a sell on the stock.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 4,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,200    Tata Chemicals | CMP: Rs 812.4        Tata Chemicals broke down below its immediate support levels of Rs 840 and Rs 825 on daily charts. With the RSI (14) around 39, the stock indicates neutral conditions. An ADX of approximately 21 signals low momentum, and based on the technical setup, the risk-reward profile favors sellers at current levels. Moreover, the stock broke and closed below its 20-period simple moving average during Friday\u2019s session, which is a negative sign. We recommend a sell on the stock.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 775, Rs 765    Stop-Loss: Rs 835    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 11,498.65        UltraTech Cement is showing a bullish setup on the daily chart, forming a 72-day-long double bottom pattern. The stock is currently hovering near a key pivot level of Rs 11,750. What makes this setup compelling is the strong accumulation seen at the base, with volume patterns indicating that weak hands have exited after a failed low. Stronger investors now appear to be in control. Technically, any dip toward the Rs 10,800\u201311,200 zone offers a solid pre-emptive buying opportunity for those eyeing a medium-term upside. The structure suggests strength, and momentum could follow soon.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 12,490    Stop-Loss: Rs 10,700    HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,817.3        HDFC Bank is showing strength on the daily chart, forming a 70-day-long Cup and Handle pattern\u2014a bullish setup often seen before strong rallies. Despite a weak broader market, the stock broke out in the previous session at Rs 1,812, signaling renewed momentum. What adds weight to this move is the base-on-base structure. The current breakout is backed by two earlier bases, neither of which saw failed moves or sharp reversals. This triple base formation suggests strong institutional support. With a clean breakout in place, HDFC Bank could be setting up for sustained upside in the sessions ahead.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,950    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,750    Axis Bank | CMP: Rs 1,091.3        Axis Bank has broken out of a bullish rounding bottom pattern on the daily chart around the Rs 1,070 mark. After the breakout, the stock pulled back slightly, nearly retesting its base\u2014an encouraging sign of strength and confirmation. The price action suggests that dips toward the Rs 1,070\u20131,060 zone offer a good risk-reward opportunity for traders. With momentum building and the structure intact, the stock is poised for an immediate upside target near Rs 1,192. As long as it holds above the support zone, Axis Bank remains a strong candidate for a buy-on-dips strategy.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,192    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "Diversified FMCG-to-cigarettes conglomerate ITC will report its earnings for the first quarter of the current fiscal year on August 1, 2025. The FMCG player is likely to report the highest revenue among all its listed peers.    According to a Moneycontrol poll of eight brokerages, ITC is likely to report revenue of Rs 17,718 crore, rising 4.2 percent year-on-year compared to Rs 17,000 crore in the April to June quarter of FY25.    Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 5,000 crore in Q1FY26 as against Rs 4,921 crore in the year-ago period, a growth of one percent.        Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees ITC\u2019s net profit growing 4.8 percent year-on-year, while the most negative projection sees a fall of 1.6 percent in net profit for the quarter.    What factors are impacting the earnings?    Cigarettes    For the quarter ended June, cigarette volumes are likely to rise in the range of 3 to 5 percent, according to most brokerages. According to BNP Paribas, the cigarette business\u2019 net revenue may grow 7.5 percent YoY, while volume growth contributing three percent and the rest led by pricing and mix.    &quot;Higher leaf tobacco prices to continue to pressure cigarettes EBIT margins, leading to 4 percent cigarette EBIT growth,&quot; according to Japan-based brokerage Nomura.    Segments performance:    In the FMCG segment, Kotak Insituttional Equities believes that revenue is expected to grow by around 5 percent year-on-year, compared to 4 percent and 3.7 percent in the third and fourth quarters of FY25, respectively.    The agri business is likely to see a stronger performance with a 10 percent year-on-year growth. In contrast, the paperboards segment is expected to post a muted 6 percent year-on-year growth amid challenging operating conditions, including weak domestic and export demand, lower net realizations, and an influx of cheaper Chinese supplies.    EBIT margin for the paperboards business is estimated at around 10 percent, slightly above the 9.6 percent and 9.2 percent recorded in the previous two quarters.    Margins    &quot;We expect a 5 percent YoY growth in cigarette EBIT, though margins  may contract 40 bps due to rising leaf tobacco prices. In the FMCG business, we expect a 16 percent decline in EBIT, with a 170 bps margin contraction as price hikes lag RM inflation,&quot; said Motilal Oswal.    What to look out for in the quarterly show?    Analysts will closely monitor demand in metro areas compared to the rural outlook, along with the competitive intensity.

        "Content": "Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India\u2019s largest conglomerate, recently made its way into the ranks of the world\u2019s 25 most valuable companies by net worth, joining the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Saudi Aramco.    The oil-retail-to-telecom major now holds the 21st spot globally with a net worth of $118 billion (Rs 10 lakh crore), just behind global majors such as Alibaba, AT&amp;amp;T, and TotalEnergies, according to Bloomberg data.    RIL\u2019s market capitalisation now stands at approximately $140 billion, more than Total SA and significantly exceeding BP Plc. RIL\u2019s market cap is now roughly equal to the combined value of 19 Nifty 50 companies, 35 public sector units and banks, or all firms listed on the Nifty Smallcap 250 index.    On Friday, Reliance Industries Ltd\u2019s board approved a fundraising plan of up to Rs 25,000 crore through bonds in one or more tranches. The board also declared a dividend of Rs 5.5 per share for its shareholders.    Ahead of the quarterly earnings announcement, Reliance shares ended the day flat at Rs 1,300.40 on the NSE. Despite the muted session, the stock has delivered a strong 7 percent gain so far in 2025, significantly outperforming the Nifty50 benchmark, which has posted less than 2 percent returns year-to-date.    The company\u2019s stock has been on a stellar run, gaining 10 percent over the past month, 24 percent in the last three months, and 40 percent over the past year, making it one of the top performers among Nifty\u2019s top 10 constituents.    Key drivers behind the stock\u2019s recent rally include its strategic debt-reduction efforts, a likely hike in telecom tariffs, and a sharpened focus on scaling its consumer businesses - Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail.

        "Content": "The market clocked a 1.3 percent rally on March 24, extending its upward journey for six days in a row. The market breadth remained positive, with about 1,720 shares advancing compared to 938 declining shares on the NSE. The benchmark indices are likely to surpass their swing high of February in the upcoming sessions. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 173.25        FSN E-Commerce Ventures (Nykaa) recently consolidated in the Rs 163-168 zone, aligning with the R3 Camarilla monthly pivot, indicating strong bullish momentum. Additionally, a bullish divergence and a falling trendline breakout in the price action are evident, confirmed by the RSI (Relative Strength Index), which further supports the bullish outlook. This combination of technical signals reinforces the likelihood of an upward move, making it an attractive opportunity for traders. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 171-174 zone, with an upside target of Rs 190.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 190    Stop-Loss: Rs 164    HCL Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,604.15        HCL Technologies has formed a base near the support zone of Rs 1,505\u20131,515. Notably, the mentioned support zone aligns with S1 and S3 of the floor and Camarilla pivots, respectively. Additionally, the RSI on the daily scale has not entered the oversold region in the last 10\u201312 sessions, further confirming the bullish outlook. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,590-1,605 zone, with an upside target of Rs 1,710.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,710    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,510    Maruti Suzuki India | CMP: Rs 11,922.25        Maruti has formed a base near the support level of Rs 11,500. Notably, this support zone aligns with the S3 Camarilla pivot. Additionally, Rs 11,500 coincides with the previous breakout zone, further affirming our bullish view. Traders may consider entering long positions above Rs 11,900, with a target of Rs 12,650.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 12,650    Stop-Loss: Rs 11,500    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Samvardhana Motherson International April Futures | CMP: Rs 133.87        Samvardhana Motherson International: Samvardhana Motherson International is trading well above its 20-day VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) levels of Rs 128, and it has witnessed significant Call unwinding in the current series, causing the PCR (Put-Call Ratio) to improve to 0.84 levels. The maximum pain levels for the April series are at Rs 130, and it is trading above that level, which is also bullish. The stock has a substantial short buildup, so there is a high probability of short covering from hereon. Traders may consider buying this stock from the point of view of short covering.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 143, Rs 147    Stop-Loss: Rs 128    Shree Cement April Futures | CMP: Rs 29,625        Shree Cement has provided a breakout from the sideways consolidation, and it has also witnessed long buildup again with this breakout, increasing the upside probability. The stock has a crucial support at Rs 28,300 levels on a closing basis, and it has a 20-day VWAP at Rs 28,115, which should hold in the near term. The stock has witnessed high Call unwinding in the current series, and there is no major call open interest until Rs 30,000 levels in this series as well as in the next series.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 30,500, Rs 30,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 28,300    Asian Paints April Futures | CMP: Rs 2,321        Asian Paints also has huge short positions and is likely to bounce back due to short covering in the markets. The price has bounced back from the lows of Rs 2,150 approximately to Rs 2,335 levels; however, the open interest has not reduced much. There has been unwinding witnessed in the Rs 2,300 strike, and the stock is trading well above those levels. Hence, further unwinding can\u2019t be ruled out. The stock is also trading above its 20-day VWAP and its maximum pain levels, so the probability of short covering is high, offering a good risk-to-reward ratio in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,440, Rs 2,480    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,290    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1718.8        Bharti Airtel is on the verge of breaking out from a 110-day-long bullish rectangle pattern at Rs 1,730. Volume trends suggest strong institutional accumulation, with rising volumes on up days and lower volumes on declines. Weekly momentum indicators, which were overheated at the start of the pattern, have now cooled off, setting the stage for a strong follow-through rally. A sustained move above Rs 1,730 could trigger a fresh momentum-driven uptrend, making the stock an attractive buy for the next leg of the breakout.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,050    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650    Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 1,894.15        Bajaj Finserv is on the verge of breaking out from an 872-day-long Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP). A failed breakout attempt earlier helped shake out weak hands, making the second attempt more potent. Volume trends throughout the base have remained ideal, with a breakout above Rs 1,920 likely to trigger strong volume expansion. With weak hands out and institutional interest building, a sustained move above this level could ignite a powerful rally, making Bajaj Finserv a stock to watch in the coming sessions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,050    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,850    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Date": "2025-06-03",
        "Description": "The market may turn positive amid rangebound trading. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices recouped significant intraday losses and closed moderately lower on June 2, while the VIX increased sharply, signaling caution for bulls. The market breadth was slightly positive, with a total of 1,386 shares showing buying interest compared to 1,254 shares that declined on the NSE. The market may turn positive amid rangebound trading. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Punjab National Bank | CMP: Rs 108.46        Punjab National Bank (PNB) is showing signs of a potential bullish reversal. A Bullish Harami candlestick pattern has formed on the weekly timeframe, indicating a possible trend shift. A strong base formation is visible near the S3 Camarilla yearly pivot, adding technical support to the setup. Additionally, the weekly RSI has decisively broken above the key 50 level\u2014now hovering around 59\u2014which further strengthens the bullish case. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 107\u2013109 zone, with an upside target of Rs 119.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 119    Stop-Loss: Rs 102    Castrol India | CMP: Rs 216.15        Castrol India has recently broken out of a consolidation range between Rs 205\u2013213, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Notably, this consolidation occurred between the R1 Floor Pivot and the R3 Camarilla Monthly Pivot, lending further credibility to the breakout as a technically significant move. During the entire consolidation phase, the daily RSI consistently held above the 50 mark, reflecting underlying strength, and is now comfortably above 60. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 214\u2013216 zone, with an upside target of Rs 240.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 240    Stop-Loss: Rs 202    Swiggy | CMP: Rs 333.3        Swiggy\u2019s price action is currently unfolding within a falling parallel channel, suggesting a phase of consolidation. However, Camarilla Pivot Analysis indicates a potential momentum shift. Over April and May, the stock formed a partial inside value setup, where each month\u2019s pivot range is partially contained within the previous month\u2019s.    April\u2019s pivot range remained within March\u2019s, and May followed suit by staying largely inside April\u2019s. This kind of compression typically precedes a high-probability breakout within 1\u20132 weeks. Adding weight to the setup, the RSI is showing a bullish divergence, signaling a likely reversal or upward move in the near term. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 300\u2013333 zone, with a target of Rs 380.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 380    Stop-Loss: Rs 300    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Bank of India | CMP: Rs 125.25        Bank of India has provided a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the open interest (OI) chart, indicating long buildup in the near term as both price and OI have moved up together. The price action suggests that as long as the Rs 120 level holds on a closing basis, the short-term trend is likely to remain positive. Previously, the stock experienced multiple whipsaws around the 20-day VWAP, but with this price-OI breakout confirmation, the short-term trend appears positive.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 131, Rs 136    Stop-Loss: Rs 120    Indian Hotels Company | CMP: Rs 783.6        Indian Hotels had seen significant long unwinding during its rally since 2023. Meanwhile, FIIs continued increasing their stake, indicating a shift of positions from futures to the equity cash segment or a handover from DIIs to FIIs.    The overall trend remained positive. However, over the past six months, the stock has corrected, accompanied by short buildup as futures positions reduced. Now, the price appears to have reversed, and short positions are getting covered, suggesting the start of a new upward leg. Thus, the risk-to-reward ratio looks favourable on the long side in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 815, Rs 830    Stop-Loss: Rs 760    Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone | CMP: Rs 1,468        Adani Ports has been consistently forming higher tops and bottoms, even as OI declines. The stock initially witnessed long unwinding, followed by short buildup toward the end, which has since seen covering. Overall OI is now quite low, creating a favourable setup for bulls to initiate long positions. The stock is trading well above its 20-day VWAP, and notable Call unwinding along with Put writing at the Rs 1,400 strike makes this the immediate crucial support level.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,535, Rs 1,580    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,395    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    Central Depository Services | CMP: Rs 1,682.9        Central Depository Services (CDSL) is exhibiting a strong price structure on the monthly chart, forming higher bottoms that signal long-term strength. On the weekly scale, the stock found buying interest near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of its prior up move (Rs 466 to Rs 1,989), with the retracement low marked in March 2025. Since then, it has been trending higher, respecting its uptrend and showing consistent follow-through. The stock is trading well above its 12-week and 26-week EMAs, reinforcing the positive trend alignment and indicating continued bullish control.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,968    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,560    Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 116.84        Canara Bank has shown a strong structural reversal, rebounding from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement near the 2017 swing high, establishing a solid long-term support base. On the weekly chart, a breakout from a falling channel and a rally\u2013base\u2013rally pattern indicate the end of the corrective phase and a resumption of the uptrend. Rising volumes above the 20-week average and a MACD crossover above the zero line confirm bullish momentum and strong market participation.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 131    Stop-Loss: Rs 109    NBCC (India) | CMP: Rs 124.80        NBCC has formed a classic double bottom on the monthly chart, signaling a strong bullish reversal. The recent recovery retraced a six-month decline in just three months, reflecting robust momentum. The stock rebounded from the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its 2022\u20132024 rally and is now forming higher highs and higher lows. Volume has risen above the 20-week average, indicating increased participation. On the daily chart, NBCC is trading above its 20, 50, and 100-day EMAs, while a rising MACD confirms sustained bullish momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 140    Stop-Loss: Rs 117    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1,854.1        Bharti Airtel is in a strong uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows across all timeframes. It recently broke out of a 7-month consolidation on the monthly chart and exhibited a bullish polarity shift on the weekly scale, closing above the prior week's high\u2014signaling renewed buying interest. Momentum indicators such as MACD and RSI support the bullish trend, suggesting continued upside potential.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,040    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

While APE remained largely in-line, the strong margin delivery for Q4FY25 was driven by 1) lower share of ULIPs, 2) increased share of Non-Par and Protection products (led by higher term and rider attachments), and 3) lower share of Group Savings business. Ahead, the management will continue to focus on the agency channel for distribution, and targets ~20-25% Retail APE growth; at the company level, Retail APE growth guidance is 13-14% for FY26. Lower contribution from ULIPs, offset by higher share of Par products, will keep margin stable at ~28%. To bake in the Q4 developments, we increase our APE and VNB margin which results in ~2% increase in FY26-27E VNB.    Outlook  We reiterate BUY and revise up our Mar-26E TP by 5.4% to Rs 1,950 (from Rs1,850 earlier), implying 2.0x FY27E P/EV.

The next quarter will be soft for the sector, as per experts, with all major IT services players seeing continued demand stress across all key verticals.    For the first quarter of FY26, TCS\u2019 net profit rose 6 percent year-on-year to Rs 12,760 crore, from Rs 12,040 crore reported in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, profit grew 4.4 percent from Rs 12,224 crore, surpassing Street expectations.    India's largest IT company also said its revenue from operations grew 1.3 percent to Rs 63,437 crore for the April-June quarter. However, on a constant currency basis (CC) it was down over three percent, given strong headwinds across major markets.    According to the management, the current geopolitical situation and economic uncertainty is leading to a cautious outlook among banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) clients in America. Investments in technology have slowed down, and all discretionary expenditure is likely to remain stressed in the September quarter as well.    Impact across some key verticals:    BFSI: According to the management\u2019s commentary, BFSI clients are looking towards regulatory readiness, data governance, and cost efficiency through technology rationalisation. However, discretionary spending remains under pressure. Softness in US insurance continued throughout Q1 FY26, while it did well in Europe. Banking and financial services continue to remain cautious in Europe and the UK, indicating muted deal conversion for IT players going ahead.    Consumer: The consumer vertical remains one of the most affected verticals as a result of funding delays, project postponements and delayed milestone completion, noted TCS. This may continue in the short-term.    Healthcare: Clients across the life science space are cautious, while pharma players are seeing strong pricing and supply chain issues. More clarity is awaited on Trump\u2019s \u2018One Big, Beautiful Bill Act\u2019, which may have a serious impact on hospital operators and medical expenses, further pressuring deal wins. Further, leading companies in the US, UK, Europe and Japan are consolidating vendors while leveraging AI.    Communication &amp;amp; Media: Enterprises in this sector are reassessing their focus areas, according to TCS, and placing greater importance on AI, automation, diversification, cost efficiency, and streamlining their vendor base.    Energy &amp;amp; Utilities: The sector is experiencing a drawback in spending and capital investments, as a result of the evolving policy landscape and ongoing geopolitical turmoil.    However, following clarity on US President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, the technology bellwether said that international markets are likely to perform better in the current financial year, compared to FY2025, as a result of improved order booking and increased customer enquiries. This poses as a positive for the entire IT pack.    \u201cAs of the international revenue of FY26, I am still confident it will be better than FY25 international revenue. But we are still trying to push the overall revenue to be much better in the coming quarters. I am still optimistic. This uncertainty cannot last long. The clarity should emerge and spending should come back,\u201d said TCS CEO K Krithivasan in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol.

        "Content": "Reliance Power shares zoomed nearly 16 percent on May 30 to hit an intraday high of Rs 60.5 apiece. Notably, this is the highest level seen by the stock in over ten years, since April 2015.    The shares are currently experiencing a surge in trading volume, nearly 2 times higher than the 10-day average. The shares of the Anil Ambani-led company have surged nearly 50 percent in the past one month. The stock has risen by a whopping 140 percent in the past one year.    Over 51.5 crore shares were involved in active trade today, as seen at 3.18 pm. This marks a whopping 245 percent jump from the volumes seen by the stock just a day ago, according to data on NSE.    Reliance Power on May 28 had announced that its subsidiary Reliance NU Energies has received a Letter of Award (LOA) for a 350 MW inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar power project coupled with a 175 MW/700 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) from Navratna PSU SJVN.    Reliance NU Energies had earlier emerged as the successful bidder in the auction for the project, with a fixed tariff of Rs 3.33/kWh for a period of 25 years. &quot;The project was part of a larger 1,200 MW solar + 600 MW/2,400 MWh BESS tender, which attracted participation from 19 developers, with 18 qualifying for the final e-reverse auction. The tender was oversubscribed by more than 4 times, reflecting heightened industry interest in dispatchable renewable energy solutions,&quot; the company said.    The latest project will add 600 MW of solar DC capacity and 700 MWh of BESS capacity to Reliance Power's portfolio. It further said that its total clean energy pipeline now stands at 2.4 GW of Solar DC capacity and over 2.5 GWH of BESS capacity, making it India's largest player in the integrated Solar + BESS segment.    &quot;The project reinforces Reliance Power\u2019s strategic commitment to renewable energy leadership, while delivering sustainable value creation across stakeholders. It marks a significant milestone in the company\u2019s strategic vision to transition toward cleaner energy sources and play a pivotal role in shaping the country\u2019s sustainable energy future,&quot; Reliance Power further said.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices hit more than a five-week high on March 20, with the Nifty 50 rising sharply by 1.2 percent as bulls gained more strength. The market breadth was also positive, with 1,640 shares rising compared to 989 shares that corrected on the NSE. The momentum is likely to sustain amid possible range-bound trading. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Mahanagar Gas | CMP: Rs 1,369.7        Mahanagar Gas is showing signs of a potential breakout from a consolidation pattern, typically a bullish reversal signal. The stock has been trading within a defined range for months, forming higher lows, indicating a gradual build-up of buying momentum. It is currently near the 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average), having taken strong support at this level, but remains below the 200-day EMA. A sustained move above the 200-day EMA could confirm a trend reversal and attract further bullish sentiment.    On the upside, resistance is seen at Rs 1,460, with a breakout potentially pushing the stock toward Rs 1,580. Immediate support is at Rs 1,300, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,250 to manage risk. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 60.52 is trending upward, indicating strengthening buying momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,580    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,250    SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 856.85        SBI Card remains in a consolidation phase within a descending channel, indicating short-term range-bound movement. The stock has been forming higher lows, suggesting buying interest at lower levels while facing resistance near Rs 890. It is trading above key EMAs (20-day, 50-day, and 200-day), reflecting a strong trend. Recently, it took support at the 200-day EMA, reinforcing a long-term bullish outlook. Sustaining above these levels could strengthen its position for an upward breakout.    On the upside, resistance is observed in the Rs 960 - Rs 1,040 range, with a breakout potentially pushing the stock toward Rs 960. Immediate support is at Rs 840, with a stop-loss at Rs 790 to manage risk. The RSI at 66.72 indicates moderate strength, suggesting room for further upside if buying interest increases.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 960, Rs 1,040    Stop-Loss: Rs 790    Gujarat Fluorochemicals | CMP: Rs 4,004.2        Gujarat Fluorochemicals is exhibiting a bullish breakout from a consolidation phase after forming a double-bottom pattern, a strong reversal signal indicating potential upward momentum. The stock is trading above key exponential moving averages, signaling a shift in momentum toward bullish territory.    The recent breakout above the Rs 3,850 resistance level suggests a change in sentiment, with increased buying pressure driving the stock higher. If the price sustains above this breakout level, further upside potential remains, with the next major resistance at Rs 4,200. A successful move above this level could push the stock toward a target of Rs 4,400. On the downside, immediate support is located at Rs 3,800. The RSI is currently at 66.62 and trending upward, reflecting growing buying momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,400    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,700    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    InterGlobe Aviation | CMP: Rs 5,086.75        InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo) has given an ascending triangle breakout on the daily chart with a surge in volumes visible. The ADX (Average Directional Index) Line is headed up, which confirms the strength of the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,414    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,932    Hindustan Aeronautics | CMP: Rs 3,819        Hindustan Aeronautics has broken out of a Pole and Flag pattern on the daily chart with a surge in volumes visible. The RSI indicator is rising, which confirms the positive momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,039    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,712    JSW Steel | CMP: Rs 1,050.25        JSW Steel has broken out of a rising channel on the daily chart with higher-than-average traded volumes. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is positively placed, which has bullish implications.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,110    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020    Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at Samco Securities    Welspun Corp | CMP: Rs 872.1        Welspun Corp has given a decisive breakout after a prolonged consolidation phase, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The stock is trading firmly above all key moving averages, indicating underlying strength and the potential for trend continuation. A sustained move above Rs 888 could unlock further upside potential, reinforcing the bullish setup. On the downside, any dip towards the Rs 850 zone could offer a buying opportunity for accumulation.    The stock is also holding above the daily Supertrend, further validating the positive structure. The RSI remains in a strong zone, hovering around 70, reflecting sustained buying interest. Additionally, robust volume participation confirms the strength of the breakout, increasing the probability of further upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 960    Stop-Loss: Rs 825    Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,193.1        Titan Company has shown a strong recovery from recent lows in the latest trading session. The stock has successfully broken above the Rs 3,120 resistance level, indicating renewed buying interest and a potential shift in momentum. The 20-day moving average is turning upward, suggesting the formation of a short-term uptrend. Additionally, the spike in trading volumes confirms strong participation from buyers, adding credibility to the rally. The RSI above 50 signals improving momentum, leaving room for further upside. Any dip towards the Rs 3,150 zone could offer a favourable entry opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,380    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030    JSW Infrastructure | CMP: Rs 295.7        JSW Infrastructure displayed notable strength in the last session, gaining 2.92%. The stock has successfully breached the key resistance zone of Rs 277-280, which had been a crucial hurdle for buyers. Now trading comfortably above the 100-day moving average, the price structure signals a continuation of bullish momentum. A strong volume surge over the past two sessions further validates buying interest, indicating heightened participation. The RSI stands at 69, reflecting sustained strength, while a bullish crossover in the daily MACD reinforces the positive outlook.

        "Date": "2025-04-19",
        "Description": "Any sustainable move above the zone of 23,900-23,940 will lead to a sharp upside rally in the Nifty 50 upto the level of 24,200, followed by 24,500 in the short term, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Data suggests that FIIs are cautiously optimistic on the market, with a focus on large-cap stability amidst market uncertainty, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.    According to him, any sustainable move above the zone of 23,900-23,940 will lead to a sharp upside rally in the Nifty 50 upto the level of 24,200, followed by 24,500 in the short term.    For the next week, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities bets on Bajaj Finserv and Indian Bank. &quot;Bajaj Finserv has given a stage-2 cup pattern breakout on a daily scale, which is accompanied by robust volume, while Indian Bank has given a 77-day consolidation breakout along with robust volume and currently, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages,&quot; he reasoned.    Technically, how do you view this rally as the Nifty 50 has surpassed its previous swing high? Given the strong weekly close, do you think it will reclaim December 2024 swing high?    &quot;The strongest rallies are born from the depths of doubt.&quot; This is what we have witnessed in the last couple of trading sessions. The benchmark index Nifty has staged a sharp rally from its recent low of 21,743.65, gaining over 2,100 points in just seven trading sessions \u2014 marking one of the fastest upswings in recent times. This remarkable rally has pushed the index above both its short and long-term moving averages. Notably, the 20-day and 50-day EMAs (Exponential Moving Average) have begun to curve upward, reinforcing the bullish momentum. Adding further strength, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) has surged past the 60 mark and continues to rise, indicating increased buying interest.    What makes this rebound even more remarkable is the context in which it has unfolded \u2014 a period clouded by uncertainty, driven by trade war tensions and looming recession fears. Yet, amid the noise and negativity, the market has managed to flip the script with a sharp turnaround. It\u2019s a classic example of how markets often recover with force just when conviction is hardest to find.    The Banking and Financial Services sectors have been the primary drivers of this rally. The Nifty Financial Services index has clocked a fresh all-time high, while Bank Nifty is just a stone\u2019s throw away from its record levels. Interestingly, the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100 indices have lagged behind in the last couple of sessions, highlighting that this rally has been primarily powered by large-cap names.    At present, the Nifty is hovering around a key resistance zone of its prior swing high\u2019s. Any sustainable move above the zone of 23,900-23,940 will lead to a sharp upside rally in the index upto the level of 24,200, followed by 24,500 in the short term. However, on the downside, 23,600-23,550 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.    How are FIIs and proprietary traders positioning themselves after the recent shift in market sentiment?    Over the last three trading sessions, FIIs have turned net buyers in the cash segment, signaling a shift in sentiment. This coincides with visible accumulation in large-cap stocks, suggesting that FIIs are selectively adding quality names to their portfolios. Additionally, the sharp rise in the long-short ratio of index futures\u2014from 21.59 to 29.52\u2014indicates that FIIs are actively covering their short positions. Taken together, this suggests a cautiously optimistic stance from FIIs, with a focus on large-cap stability amidst market uncertainty.    Do you believe Bank Nifty will be a major driver and a supportive factor for the broader market going forward?    Absolutely. The banking index Bank Nifty has been clearly outperforming the broader market over the last few sessions. It\u2019s just a stone\u2019s throw away from its all-time high, while Nifty still trades more than 9% below its peak \u2014 a clear sign of sectoral strength.    What\u2019s even more interesting is the ratio chart of Bank Nifty versus Nifty, which is now at an 81-week high, reinforcing the relative outperformance.    Technically, with the index hovering near all-time highs, all key moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned positively, indicating strong bullish momentum. We expect this northward journey to continue, with Bank Nifty likely heading toward the 55,000 mark in the near term. On the flip side, the 53,800\u201353,700 zone is expected to act as immediate support in case of any short-term dip. Hence, Bank Nifty is well-positioned to act as a major driver for the broader market in the sessions ahead.    Is this a good time to consider positions in ABB India, ICICI Bank, and Zomato?    ABB India and Zomato have recently broken out of consolidation zones, closing above both their short and long-term moving averages \u2014 a strong bullish signal. The daily RSI for both stocks also indicates rising momentum, further supporting the breakout.    ICICI Bank, on the other hand, continues to outperform the frontline indices and is currently trading at an all-time high. All key moving averages and momentum indicators are aligned in favour of the bulls, suggesting the uptrend is intact.    Given the strong chart structures and positive momentum, ABB India, ICICI Bank, and Zomato can be considered for short-term positions.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Bajaj Finserv    On Friday, the stock has given a stage-2 cup pattern breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on a breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Currently, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 2,040-2,020 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,960. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,150 in the short term.    Indian Bank    The stock has given a 77-day consolidation breakout along with robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising trajectory. The daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 576-571 level with a stop-loss of Rs 550. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 615 in the short term.

        "Date": "2025-04-29",
        "Description": "With this strong bounce back, the overall trend remains healthy, despite the potential for continued consolidation. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Bulls staged a strong comeback on April 28, driving the benchmark indices higher by more than 1 percent. However, similar strength was not seen in the market breadth. About 1,342 shares advanced compared to 1,235 declining shares on the NSE. With this strong bounce back, the overall trend remains healthy, despite the potential for continued consolidation. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 390        Birlasoft is showing signs of a 427-day cycle, which somewhat aligns with Gann\u2019s Square of 144 (144 \u00d7 3 = 432), indicating a potential time-based reversal. Currently, the stock has reversed from its major support at Rs 330, coinciding with the previous breakout zone from May 2023. This price-time confluence, combined with a hidden bullish divergence on the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index), strengthens the case for a possible bottom formation. Consider entering long positions in the Rs 380\u2013390 zone, with an upside target of Rs 485.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 485    Stop-Loss: Rs 330    Sonata Software | CMP: Rs 362.75        At the current juncture, Sonata Software is trading near a key Fibonacci retracement cluster, where 0.886 retracement from the May 2022 low, 0.707 retracement from the March 2020 low, and 0.618 retracement from the October 2001 low, converging around the Rs 291\u2013330 range. The current price is approximately Rs 362. A bullish divergence is observed on the weekly chart, suggesting potential upside. The confluence of major retracements, along with positive momentum signals, strengthens the bullish outlook. Consider entering long positions in the Rs 355\u2013365 zone, with an upside target of Rs 430.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 430    Stop-Loss: Rs 325    Hindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,318.6        Hindustan Unilever recently experienced a pullback after breaking above the Rs 2,300 levels and is currently trading around Rs 2,330. On April 24, the stock briefly tested the Rs 2,300 mark post its results announcement. Despite the dip, the overall chart structure remains bullish, with the 2x target from the previous consolidation zone still intact. Consider entering long positions between Rs 2,300\u20132,330, with a target of Rs 2,550.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,550    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,195    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Reliance Industries Futures | CMP: Rs 1,371.4        Reliance has cleared its crucial hurdle at Rs 1,300. Above this level, Call unwinding was witnessed, supporting the stock\u2019s upward movement. There has been continuous short covering in the futures segment, following the lifetime high Open Interest (OI) in short positions.    A positive divergence is observed, as the last two times the stock hit a 52-week low, the OI declined, suggesting short covering and limited downside. The stock has now recovered sharply and is expected to perform well in the short to medium term. Buy Reliance Industries Futures on dips in the Rs 1,340\u20131,350 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,400, Rs 1,450    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,285    Bharat Electronics Futures | CMP: Rs 307.45        Bharat Electronics Futures has moved above its 20-day VWAP of Rs 293.7, hence a stop-loss at Rs 293 is recommended. The stock previously attempted to break past its swing highs on two occasions but lacked momentum, primarily due to long unwinding. However, the reduction in OI along with the price indicates no short buildup, making the futures positioning light and favoring upside.    Options data shows that the Rs 310 strike holds the highest Call base, suggesting short-term resistance. A move above this level may result in further upward momentum, as the overall trend favours the bulls. Buy Bharat Electronics Futures in the Rs 308\u2013Rs 304 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 322, Rs 330    Stop-Loss: Rs 293    UltraTech Cement Futures | CMP: Rs 12,213        The cement sector has shown strong resilience during recent market declines, with UltraTech Cement outperforming the Nifty. The stock has broken out of a long consolidation, accompanied by a long build-up, indicating a positive short- to medium-term outlook.    While the stock is trading above its 20-day VWAP, it is still below its maximum pain level, implying the possibility of sideways movement before the uptrend resumes. However, based on its futures positioning, the stock is likely to trend higher eventually. Buy UltraTech Cement Futures in the Rs 11,900\u2013Rs 12,300 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 13,000, Rs 13,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 11,400    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Author": "Vikas SN",
        "Content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered answer engine Perplexity is offering a one-year free subscription to its premium tier, Perplexity Pro, to customers of Bharti Airtel, India's second-largest telecom operator.    The offer will be available to all 360 million prepaid and postpaid mobile customers, and broadband customers of Airtel.    This marks the company\u2019s first partnership with a telecom operator in India, as part of its efforts to drive adoption in the world\u2019s second-largest internet market. Perplexity has struck similar deals with firms such as SoftBank and T-Mobile over the past year.    Airtel customers can avail this subscription through the rewards section of its Airtel Thanks app until January 17, 2026. Perplexity charges $20 (approximately Rs 1,731) per month for its premium subscription service across most of the world, including India.    Airtel noted that the subscription would not auto-renew. Users will have to upgrade to a paid plan through Perplexity, else their account will automatically switch to the free version. One also has to be an active Airtel customer for the full 12-month period.    &quot;This collaboration will bring the powerful and real-time knowledge tool for millions of users at their fingertips, at no extra cost. This first of its kind Gen-AI partnership in India is focused on helping our customers navigate the emerging trends in the digital world with confidence and ease,&quot; said Gopal Vittal, Vice Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Bharti Airtel in a statement.    Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas said \u201cThis partnership is an exciting way to make accurate, trustworthy, and professional-grade AI accessible to more people in India\u2014whether a student, working professional, or managing a household. With Perplexity Pro, users get a smarter, easier way to find information, learn, and get more done.\u201d    Interestingly, this move comes on the heels of rival Google offering a one-year free subscription to its premium AI tools to college students in India. This includes access to the company's flagship AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini\u2019s Deep Research feature, AI video generator Veo 3, and higher usage limits in NotebookLM.    Perplexity, which seeks to disrupt Google\u2019s flagship search engine, has seen growing adoption of its service in India in recent years. In April, Srinivas told Moneycontrol that India is among the company\u2019s top 10 countries by revenue and top four markets by daily traffic.    At the time, Srinivas had said he was pleasantly surprised by the willingness of people in India to pay for the product despite an expensive price point.    &quot;A lot of people are using the deep research agent that we have, our pro search is being used by a lot of people too. In terms of daily query traffic too, it (India) is in the top five or top four (market) for us. So, it's a pretty important market&quot; he said.    Srinivas had also stated plans of rolling out a lower India-specific pricing for Perplexity Pro to grow its subscriber base in the country.    The service has also been focusing on incorporating local content, including cricket-related content, to attract more people to its answer engine. Earlier this year, it launched a dedicated IPL page where users can track league standings, match schedules, and the latest news.    &quot;There are lots of searches on cricket that are already happening with Perplexity, and we want to keep growing that. We also plan to incorporate other content that's interesting to Indian audiences like entertainment, TV shows, movies, local results, and better support for local language content,&quot; Srinivas said in April.    Perplexity also partnered with digital payments giant Paytm in February to integrate its AI answer engine into the payments app.    Founded in 2022 by Srinivas, Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho and Andy Konwinski, Perplexity was last valued at $9 billion when it raised $500 million funding led by Institutional Venture Partners.    The startup, which counts Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among its backers, is said to be in advanced talks to raise fresh funds at a $14 billion valuation.",

However, we continue to believe in our sector revival hypothesis (of reducing competitive intensity) and of UTCEM being its largest beneficiary. Our confidence stems from \u2013 a) Q4FY25 EBITDA for domestic operations being at a high of INR 1,270/t, up 7% YoY (including India Cements and Kesoram Inds, it stood INR 1,126); b) benefits of recent price increase in South India (of &amp;gt;10% QoQ) and other regions (1-2%) which could drive margin improvement further; c) continued assurance to demonstrate cost savings of ~INR 300/t by FY27 (INR 86/t achieved in FY25) and d) capex-led plan in place to pull up cost efficiency for both ICEM and Kesoram. It is with this confidence that we \u2013 1) broadly retain our FY26E EBITDA; 2) introduce FY27E EBITDA assuming 13% growth and 3) increase our valuation multiple from 18x EV/EBITDA to 19x.  Outlook  Rolling over valuation to FY27E, we maintain BUY with revised TP of INR 13,992 (vs INR 13,033 earlier).

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Citi Research became the latest brokerage to reaffirm a bullish outlook on Reliance Industries Ltd, with most brokers citing strong momentum in the conglomerate\u2019s telecom and retail businesses as drivers that will fuel growth.    Citi maintained its \u2018buy\u2019 rating on RIL, raising its target price to Rs 1,690 per share, citing strong growth potential in Jio, driven by structural levers beyond the anticipated tariff hikes. The brokerage pencilled in a three-year consolidated EBITDA CAGR of 16 percent for Jio, assigning the business an enterprise value of $135 billion.    The broker noted that much of the market\u2019s focus remains on the upcoming round of tariff hikes, but Citi said that there are several underappreciated growth drivers, ranging from subscriber upgrades and digital services expansion to operating efficiency. These will all fuel Jio\u2019s long-term momentum, leading Citi to see a 6-7 percent growth from the non-tariff avenues.    Furthermore, there could be further upside for Jio from the revenue market share and improving margins. The Indian telecom sector, particularly Reliance Jio, is far from the saturation or low-growth phase seen in more developed markets.    Citi believes that Jio is well-positioned to take advantage of the sector\u2019s evolving landscape, and its structural tailwinds offer a long runway for sustained performance.    At 9.20 a.m., shares of the firm were quoting Rs 1,466.5 on the NSE, up one percent.    Follow our market blog to catch all the updates    Earlier this month, Reliance Industries also received a vote of confidence from Bernstein and Goldman Sachs, with both reaffirming their bullish outlook on the firm.    Bernstein raised its target price for Reliance Industries shares to Rs 1,640 per share, indicating an upside potential of 15 percent from current levels. Further, the brokerage maintained its \u2018outperform\u2019 rating on RIL shares due to strong growth momentum.    Goldman Sachs added Reliance Industries to its APAC Conviction List, along with Taiwan-based TSMC and China\u2019s Huaqin. The international brokerage believes that Reliance Industries\u2019 EBITDA growth could rebound to 16 percent in FY26, compared to two percent in FY25.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices bounced back after a day of correction and recouped all of the previous day's losses on May 23, supported by positive market breadth. A total of 1,580 shares saw buying interest compared to 977 shares that declined on the NSE. The market is expected to continue rangebound trading until the index decisively surpasses and sustains above the high of the month of May. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    IndoStar Capital Finance | CMP: Rs 336        On the daily and weekly timeframes, IndoStar Capital Finance is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. Additionally, the stock has confirmed an &quot;Inverse Head &amp;amp; Shoulders&quot; pattern breakout at Rs 330 levels on a closing basis. Rising volumes at the breakout zone signify increased participation.    The stock is trading well above its 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), and these averages are also inching up along with rising prices\u2014reconfirming bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicate that buying may occur at current levels. The daily and weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal also indicates increased momentum. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 385, Rs 410    Stop-Loss: Rs 310    Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,332.6        On the daily timeframe, Cyient has experienced a trend reversal, confirming a &quot;Double Bottom&quot; formation at Rs 1,255 levels. The 20-day and 50-day positive crossover further signals bullish sentiment. The daily Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily and weekly RSI suggest that buying may occur at current levels. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,385, Rs 1,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,295    Dhanuka Agritech | CMP: Rs 1,678.5        On the daily and weekly charts, Dhanuka Agritech has decisively surpassed its multiple resistance zone at Rs 1,650, accompanied by huge volumes, indicating strong participation. The stock is trading well above its 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs, and all these averages are inching upward along with rising prices\u2014reaffirming bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI is in positive terrain, showing rising strength across all timeframes. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,930    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,620    Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One    Som Distilleries &amp;amp; Breweries | CMP: Rs 152.99        After two years of consolidation, Som Distilleries &amp;amp; Breweries has staged a decisive long-term breakout, backed by a surge in volumes, signaling renewed investor interest. Strengthening the breakout, the RSI has crossed above the 60 mark, indicating strong bullish momentum and the potential for a sustained uptrend. Hence, we recommend buying Som Distilleries &amp;amp; Breweries around Rs 153\u2013Rs 150.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 170    Stop-Loss: Rs 144    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises | CMP: Rs 7,064.5        Following a strong rally in April, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises entered a consolidation phase. It has now broken out of a continuation symmetrical pattern, signaling a potential resumption of the uptrend. Prices are trading above all major moving averages, and momentum oscillators are firmly in the bullish zone, reinforcing the positive outlook and supporting a buy recommendation. Hence, we recommend buying Apollo Hospitals Enterprises around Rs 7,065\u2013Rs 7,040.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 7,400    Stop-Loss: Rs 6,890    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 2,780.6        TVS Motor is forming a 149-day-long Cup and Handle pattern, with a tight right-side consolidation between Rs 2,835\u2013Rs 2,720. Volume patterns in the base are constructive, marked by higher volumes on up days and lower volumes on down days, signaling institutional accumulation. The stock is well-positioned for a breakout, and a decisive move above the Rs 2,850 pivot level is likely to trigger fresh bullish momentum. Post-breakout, the stock can rally towards the Rs 3,100 zone in the coming weeks.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,100    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,725    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 780.4        HDFC Life has broken out of a massive 219-week Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern with an open=low and a strong weekly close. Although the breakout volume wasn\u2019t extraordinary, the base saw consistent accumulation\u2014a pattern common in large-cap moves where volume often picks up on follow-through days. The technical structure now favours bulls, and a sustained move is likely. The stock is a buy at current levels, with dips to Rs 745 offering a good accumulation opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 900    Stop-Loss: Rs 740    Macrotech Developers | CMP: Rs 1,412.8        Lodha has broken out of a 54-day Double Bottom pattern and is now forming a rare base-on-base-on-base setup, indicating sustained accumulation. The presence of a double base above a previous breakout adds strength to the bullish structure. The triple base breakout is placed at Rs 1,450, and a decisive move above this level will likely trigger a strong uptrend. If volumes support the breakout, the stock can rally towards Rs 1,600 in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The market breadth remained in favour of the bulls, with about 1,806 shares advancing against 798 declining on the NSE.

The stock has consistently respected its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), with every minor dip being absorbed quickly\u2014indicating accumulation at lower levels. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is trending upward, reinforcing the bullish momentum and suggesting the recent breakout could see further follow-through. The overall structure remains constructive with potential for a sustained upside toward the Rs 5,000 mark.

The MACD has entered a clear bullish crossover, with histogram bars expanding on the positive side. Volume also showed an uptick on the breakout day, confirming participation. The setup suggests potential for further upside if it sustains above Rs 715.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 745    Stop-Loss: Rs 688    UltraTech Cement | CMP: Rs 11,894        UltraTech Cement has broken out of a narrow consolidation band, after trading sideways between Rs 11,530 and RS 11,860. The breakout is supported by a strong bullish candle, which closed above the upper boundary and near the day\u2019s high\u2014signalling increased buying interest. The stock is now comfortably above the 9 EMA and 20 SMA, while the 50-day moving average is sloping upward, confirming a positive undertone.    The RSI has turned upward and crossed 55, indicating renewed bullish momentum. The price has also crossed above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the previous decline, adding confirmation. Volume has shown a mild uptick, supporting the breakout structure. Sustaining above this zone may trigger follow-through buying and open the door for higher levels in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 12,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 11,640    Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking    Macrotech Developers | CMP: Rs 1,371        Lodha is consolidating within a wide trading range, forming a Descending Triangle pattern on the daily chart. The stock is now on the verge of a breakout, with recent price action reflecting strong bullish intent. A robust bullish candle on the daily timeframe further reinforces the potential for a directional move.    A breakout and sustained trade above the Rs 1,400 mark would confirm the pattern breakout and could set the stage for a short-term rally toward Rs 1,520. This level now acts as a crucial resistance zone, and a decisive move beyond it may open the path for further gains. Momentum indicators support this scenario\u2014the RSI at 60.97 is showing an upward reversal, suggesting strengthening momentum.    Additionally, Lodha has recently bounced above all key moving averages (short-, medium-, and long-term EMAs), signalling a shift toward bullish control and overall technical strength. From a price action perspective, the stock appears to be transitioning from a consolidation phase to an upward breakout, with renewed buying interest near its base\u2014making the current setup favourable from a risk-reward standpoint.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,520    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300    Eris Lifesciences | CMP: Rs 1,482.4        Eris Lifesciences is showing signs of a potential breakout after a prolonged consolidation phase. The stock has been trading within a well-defined horizontal range, forming a rectangle pattern. This consolidation, following a strong prior uptrend, suggests a possible continuation pattern, with price currently hovering near the upper resistance of the range.    A strong bullish candle has formed on the daily chart, closing near the upper boundary of the range\u2014suggesting rising buying interest. A decisive and sustained breakout above the Rs 1,510\u2013Rs 1,520 zone could confirm the pattern breakout, opening the door for a short-term rally toward Rs 1,660, based on the height of the consolidation range.    Eris is trading above all major moving averages\u2014short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs\u2014indicating a well-aligned bullish trend. The convergence of these averages below current price lends additional strength and serves as dynamic support. Momentum indicators also support the bullish scenario\u2014the RSI at 57.48 is trending upward, reflecting strengthening momentum and rising buyer interest. Volume patterns show steady accumulation near support and increasing activity near the breakout zone, hinting at institutional participation.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,660    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,395    Linde India | CMP: Rs 7,154    Linde India has witnessed a strong breakout from both a descending trend line and a horizontal consolidation range. The price action reflects a significant bullish development, with the stock surging strongly and supported by a rise in volumes.    The chart displays a clear descending trend line connecting lower highs since the April 2024 peak, which the stock has convincingly broken above. Simultaneously, it also broke out of a broad consolidation range that had capped prices for several months. This dual breakout signals a strong shift in market sentiment from sideways to bullish.    The stock has reclaimed all key moving averages\u2014including the 20 EMA (short-term), 50 EMA (medium-term), and 200 EMA (long-term)\u2014adding further confirmation to the bullish setup. The alignment of these moving averages now offers strong support on any minor pullbacks.    The RSI is at 72.43, entering the overbought zone\u2014a signal of strength during breakout phases, especially when supported by volume expansion.

        "Content": "Telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd shares rose in trade on Wednesday, August 6, after the telecommunications giant reported its earnings show for the three months ended June 30, 2025.    Bharti Airtel reported 43 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,948 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, marking its fifth straight quarter of profit growth. Airtel\u2019s revenue from operations rose 28 percent year-on-year to Rs 49,463 crore in the June quarter, up from Rs 38,506 crore a year earlier.    At 9.20 a.m., shares of Airtel were quoting Rs 1,959.1, higher by 1.4 percent on the NSE.    Airtel\u2019s smartphone user base grew by 21.3 million year-on-year and 3.9 million sequentially, now making up 77 percent of its mobile users. It added 0.7 million postpaid users, taking the total to 26.6 million. Mobile data usage rose 21.6% YoY, with per-user monthly consumption at 26.9 GB.    To boost network performance, Airtel added around 1,800 towers and 7,500 broadband sites this quarter, and installed about 15,400 towers and 43,700 km of fiber over the year.    The Homes business saw a 25.7 percent YoY revenue jump, with a record 939,000 new Wi-Fi users, taking the home broadband base to 11 million. Airtel also added 1.6 million home-pass fiber connections during the quarter.    International brokerage Morgan Stanley maintained its 'equal-weight' call on the telecom player, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share. The brokerage noted that the India business of the firm delivered a beat on the EBITDA front, while Airtel's India mobile business ARPU (average revenue per user) was trending in the right direction at Rs 250. Further, the capital expenditure of Rs 5,450 crore was lower than estimates, reducing consolidated net debt.    Hong Kong-based CLSA kept its 'outperform' rating intact, issuing a target price of Rs 2,035 per share. CLSA said that Airtel was leading on the ARPU  front, while recording strong subscriber gains; the net additions for Homes were at an all-time high.    Macquarie, too, maintained its 'outperform' tag, with a price target of Rs 2,050 per share amid strong ARPU gain, capex control, and record free cash flow. The brokerage noted that Airtel posted a strong print in India mobile with ARPU and FCF tracking above forecasts.    &quot;Record FCF generation in particular will likely drive positive sentiment as the Street was mixed on capex trajectory and FCF delivery,&quot; added Macquarie.

        "Content": "Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities bullish on Indian Oil Corporation and DLF for next week. &quot;Indian Oil Corporation has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale, accompanied above 50-day average volume, while DLF is on the verge of giving trendline breakout on a daily scale,&quot; he reasoned.    He is also bullish on Godrej Properties, and Persistent Systems.    &quot;Godrej Properties has given a neckline breakout of Adam &amp;amp; Adam Double Bottom pattern, supported by robust volume, while Persistent Systems has recently surged above its short and long-term moving averages and its daily RSI is about to cross 60 mark,&quot; the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    Technically, according to him, IndusInd Bank is showing signs of strength, but despite the bullish chart setup, he recommends avoiding fresh buying at this stage until there\u2019s more clarity.    Are you highly bullish on Godrej Properties and Persistent Systems?    Godrej Properties    The stock has given a neckline breakout of Adam &amp;amp; Adam Double Bottom pattern. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle on a breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Currently, the stock is trading above its 20 and 50-day EMA level. These averages are started edging higher, which is a bullish sign. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) surged above 60 mark for the first time after December 2024. Hence, we are bullish on this stock.    Persistent Systems    The Nifty IT has been outperforming the frontline indices since the last couple of trading sessions. Persistent Systems has recently surged above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is about to cross 60 mark. Hence, we are bullish on this stock.    Do you foresee a strong breakout in the Nifty 50 next week, following more than a week of consolidation?    The benchmark index Nifty wrapped up April with an impressive gain of 3.46 percent. Notably, it formed a sizeable bullish candle with a long lower shadow on the monthly chart, reflecting strong buying interest whenever the index dipped to lower levels. This positive price structure underscores the market's underlying strength and resilience.    What adds more weight to this rally is that it came amidst persistent global challenges. Despite concerns over trade war tensions, geopolitical strain between India and Pakistan, and a sharp decline in the US dollar index, the domestic market held its ground, supported by steady buying and improving investor sentiment.    From a technical perspective, Nifty continues to trade well above its key short and long-term moving averages, which further reinforces the bullish bias. Interestingly, the daily RSI has recently taken support near 60 mark and thereafter witnessed a rebound, which is a bullish sign as per RSI range shift rules. However, we believe the index is likely to consolidate in a broad range of 24,600-23,800 level as investors remain cautious amid the anticipated geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.    In the near term, the zone of 24,200-24,170 will serve as immediate support. A slip below 24,170 could open the door for further downside towards the stronger support zone of 23,850-23,800. On the upside, the 24,550-24,600 zone will act as a key hurdle. A sustained move above 24,600 could trigger a sharp rally towards 24,850, with the next target placed near the 25,100 mark.    Do you think this is the right time to buy IndusInd Bank?    Technically, IndusInd Bank is showing signs of strength. The stock has built a solid base between Rs 630-720 zone and has since started forming higher tops and higher bottoms, which is a classic bullish structure. It has also crossed above its short-term moving averages, and the daily RSI moving past the 60 mark further confirms the positive momentum.    However, from a fundamental and sentiment perspective, we would advise caution. The recent corporate governance concerns have clouded the outlook, and despite the bullish chart setup, we recommend avoiding fresh buying at this stage until there\u2019s more clarity.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Indian Oil Corporation    The stock has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by above 50-day average volume. In addition, it has surged above its 200-day EMA level for the first time after October 2024, which is a bullish sign. The daily RSI is in a bullish zone, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 144-142 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 135. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 160 in the short term.    DLF    The stock is on the verge of giving trendline breakout on a daily scale. It is currently trading above its 20 and 50-day EMA level. The daily RSI is quoting above 55, and it is in rising mode, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 690-685 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 665. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 750 in the short term.    Do you expect Bank Nifty to consolidate between its previous record high and the new record high in the coming week, or is there a possibility of a significant breakout?    The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has delivered a standout performance, strongly outperforming the broader frontline indices. Most notably, the index scaled a fresh all-time high during the April month, underscoring the strength in the banking space. By the end of April, Bank Nifty closed with an impressive gain of nearly 7 percent, extending its leadership role in the market rally.    Currently, with the index trading near its record-high levels, all key moving averages and momentum-based indicators are firmly aligned to the upside, reflecting strong underlying bullish momentum. However, following its sharp rally, Bank Nifty has entered a phase of consolidation over the past seven trading sessions. This pause is seen as a healthy sign, allowing the index to digest recent gains and build a base for the next leg of the move.    The broader technical setup remains favourable, but near-term consolidation may continue before fresh upward momentum resumes. Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 55,900-56,000 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above 56,000 levels will lead to sharp upside rally upto the level of 56,600, followed by 57000 in the short term. While, on the downside, the zone of 54,500-54,400 will act as immediate support for the index.

        "Description": "HDFC Bank share price:  Chandan Taparia from Motilal Oswal expects Bank Nifty cross 58,000 over next 2-3 weeks.",
        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "Bank stocks recorded significant gains on June 26, pushing the Nifty Bank index higher up in the green to hit a fresh all-time high of 57,263.45. The surge in the segment was led by heavy buying in private bank stocks.    Heavyweight HDFC Bank shares jumped nearly 2 percent to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 2,027 apiece, closing as one of the top gainers and biggest contributors to the uptrend in benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty.    HDFC Bank shares have now extended gains for the third consecutive session. This comes as its subsidiary HDB Financial Services sees decent investor interest for its Rs 12,500 IPO.    Notably, HDFC Bank had set tomorrow (June 27) as the record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive its dividend payment. The rise in the share price comes ahead of the record date.    AU Small Finance Bank shares rose over 1.7 percent to close at Rs 821 apiece, while Axis Bank shares gained 1.5 percent to end the session at Rs 1,231 apiece.    ICICI Bank shares were trading nearly 1 percent higher, while IndusInd Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.    Dodging the uptrend in the segment, the shares of State Bank of India (SBI), Federal Bank, and IDFC First Bank were trading in the red with marginal losses.    Will Bank Nifty cross 58,000 soon?    Analysts however expect the bullish rally to continue, with Bank Nifty hitting further highs. &quot;Overall, I expect Bank Nifty to cross 58,000 over next 2-3 weeks. If it holds above 56,250, looks for an upside target of 57,050 today. I am expecting momentum in both Nifty and Bank Nifty post this expiry,&quot; said Chandan Taparia, Senior Vice President, Head - Derivatives &amp;amp; Technical Research, Motilal Oswal.    What led to the rally?    Ajay Bagga, Independent Analyst, meanwhile held India's macroeconomic indicators as key to the index's growth. &quot;Given the manifold actions by RBI, which has cut rates, injected ample liquidity into the money markets, has been pragmatic in undertaking macro prudential easing and has been providing regulatory relief, banks are poised to benefit in the next few quarters. India's robust macro, tailwinds from a good monsoon, income tax relief injecting some purchasing power in the pockets of the middle class and falling inflation all have created a good backdrop for credit growth,&quot; he said.    Bhavik Joshi, Business Head at INVasset PMS, cited the liquidity-driven shift in the Indian financial ecosystem as a key factor behind the surge in Bank Nifty. &quot;The Reserve Bank of India has been at the forefront, executing a series of bold monetary actions to stimulate the economy. These include a total of 100 bps in repo rate cuts this year (25 bps each in February and April, followed by 50 bps in June), alongside a 100 bps CRR reduction. Most notably, the RBI recently conducted a $10 billion (\u20b987,000 crore) 3-year USD/INR swap, injecting long-term liquidity into the system,&quot; he said.    &quot;Bank Nifty's leadership in 2025 is a reflection of this macro transformation. It\u2019s not just a stock index hitting highs\u2014it\u2019s the financial heartbeat of a growing economy, powered by a central bank committed to supporting India\u2019s next phase of expansion,&quot; he added.    Sunny Agrawal of SBI Securities highlighted the surge in HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank's shares as a significant driver of the surge in the bank index. &quot;HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank account for approximately 50% of the Bank Nifty weight and today we have seen HDFC Bank hitting life high thereby pulling the entire index up. Moreover, ICICI Bank is also trading very close to its life highs. Overall, banks are well placed to enjoy better credit growth, on the back of recent drop in repo rate, albeit, NIMs may come under pressure during 1QFY26 and then gradually improving during FY26, with strong exit in 4QFY26,&quot; he said.    Bank Nifty has been outperforming the Nifty 50 index since the beginning of 2025, posting gains of nearly 12 percent compared to the benchmark's 8 percent gain, said Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking. Speaking about today's rise Singh said that the uptrend was helped by RBI's recent steps like cutting interest rates and reducing CRR, which made investors more confident about the profits of banks.    &quot;On the technical charts, Bank Nifty is likely to move towards the 57,800\u201358,200 zone in the near term, provided it sustains firmly above the 56,800-breakout level. For the July expiry, the highest open interest build-up is observed at the 56,000 strike, indicating strong support. Overall, sentiment remains positive, with 56,500\u201356,200 acting as a key support zone and 57,200 as the immediate hurdle for further upside. Traders can look to deploy a \u201cBuy on Dips\u201d strategy in the banking index,&quot; Singh said.    Nifty Financial Services also recorded significant rise today. The index jumped nearly 1 percent to hit a fresh record high of 27,144. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, Jio Financial Services, Shriram Finance and Bajaj Finance surged over 2 percent each to emerge as the top gainers on the index.

Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Zensar Technologies | CMP: Rs 720.75        Zensar Technologies is on the verge of breaking out from an Inverted Head and Shoulders pattern \u2014 a classic bullish reversal signal. The breakout is supported by increasing trading volumes, along with the formation of higher highs and higher lows, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 55.34 and is trending upwards, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.    On the downside, immediate support is seen around the Rs 700 level, presenting a buying opportunity on dips. To manage risk, traders are advised to place a stop-loss at Rs 685. If the bullish momentum continues, the stock could potentially rally towards Rs 800 and Rs 840 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 800, Rs 840    Stop-Loss: Rs 685    Orient Electric | CMP: Rs 235.62        Orient Electric is showing strong technical potential. The stock has recently broken out of a descending trendline and has since retested the breakout level, which is a positive sign of strength. Now, it appears to be on the verge of a fresh breakout, supported by significant volume, hinting at renewed buying interest.    Technically, the stock is trading above all key EMAs, indicating a solid uptrend. The RSI stands at 59.62 and is trending upward, further reinforcing the bullish momentum. A decisive close above Rs 245 would act as a major breakout confirmation and could open the door for a sharp upward move in the short term.    On the downside, Rs 230 serves as immediate support, making it a favourable zone for dip-buying. If momentum sustains post-breakout, Orient Electric has the potential to rally toward Rs 260 and Rs 270, making it a compelling opportunity for short-term traders and swing investors.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 260, Rs 270    Stop-Loss: Rs 220    APL Apollo Tubes | CMP: Rs 1,663.3        APL Apollo Tubes has recently broken out of a descending triangle pattern with strong volume on the weekly chart, indicating a potential trend reversal. The stock is on the verge of breaking out, signaling strong bullish momentum in both the short and long term. A decisive close above Rs 1,670 will reinforce the uptrend, paving the way for further gains. The RSI at 59.48 suggests positive momentum with room for upside movement.    On the downside, immediate support is placed at Rs 1,600, which could act as a buying zone on dips. A prudent stop-loss at Rs 1,480 is recommended to manage risk. If the momentum sustains, short-term and long-term targets of Rs 1,900 and Rs 2,000 could be achieved. Traders should closely monitor price action and volume to confirm the breakout.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,900, Rs 2,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570    Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities    ITC | CMP: Rs 430.6        ITC has resumed its upward momentum after a brief consolidation phase, closing above key short-term moving averages, including the 9 EMA and 20 SMA. This recovery has been marked by a stable sequence of higher highs and higher lows, reflecting buying interest. The stock has also managed to reclaim its 20-day SMA. The short-term support remains near Rs 424\u2013426. The bullish structure remains intact, as the weekly chart also displays a positive trend.    The daily RSI is trending near the 58 level, maintaining positive momentum without approaching overbought territory. The price action suggests the potential for a steady move higher, provided it sustains above Rs 424. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position in ITC at the CMP (current market price).    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 448    Stop-Loss: Rs 422    CRISIL | CMP: Rs 5,010.3    CRISIL has registered a decisive breakout from its recent consolidation zone, with a sharp upmove of over 6.6 percent on strong volumes in the previous session, indicating a renewed bullish outlook. The stock has broken a key resistance near Rs 4,840 and is now trading comfortably above all major moving averages, including the 9-day EMA. The breakout is also accompanied by a strong bullish candle that confirms follow-through buying and a shift in momentum.    The indicators strengthen the bullish tone as the RSI has surged above 65, while the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is in a wide positive crossover, and signal lines are sloping upward. The stock has also closed above the supertrend resistance band, signaling a potential trend reversal in favour of the bulls. The stock\u2019s ongoing formation of a saucer pattern provides an additional bullish setup. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position in CRISIL at the CMP.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,350    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,840    Timken India | CMP: Rs 2,780.9        Timken India has resumed its upward trajectory after a brief correction, with the stock posting a strong green candle and closing near the day's high. The stock has reclaimed the 9 EMA and 20 SMA, which confirms a bullish realignment. The recent price action has broken past a near-term congestion zone. The stock has also registered a higher high and lower low formation, strengthening the trend.    The daily RSI has crossed the 60 mark with a bullish slope, indicating rising momentum, while the volume has seen a notable uptick, supporting the price expansion. The recent price recovery from sub-Rs 2,500 levels and breakout above the Rs 2,750 zone displays additional confirmation of a sustained move on the upside. The rising stock delivery percentage could contribute to the trend's continuation. One can initiate a long position in Timken at the CMP.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,960    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,655    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    Hindustan Aeronautics | CMP: Rs 4,422.9        Hindustan Aeronautics is retesting its breakout from a falling trendline on the daily chart, with higher-than-average traded volumes visible. The RSI indicator is positively placed, which has bullish implications.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,720    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,290    BSE | CMP: Rs 6,690        BSE has given a range breakout and is heading upwards with a surge in volumes. The RSI indicator is rising, which confirms the bullish implications.

        "Content": "The shares of several IT companies dropped on June 18, pushing the Nifty IT index down over half a percent to hover in the red and snap a three-day gaining streak. This comes as investors may have resorted to profit booking at elevated levels, while awaiting a possible rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.    The Nifty IT index stood at around 39,138 in the morning, bucking the overall market trend with benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty being in the green.    Notably, IT stocks had recorded significant gains recently. The Nifty IT index closed in the green in nine out of the last 10 sessions, dodging the overall volatility in the market. This came on the back of expectations of US Federal Reserve announcing a rate cut today after its meeting. Softer inflation and weakening jobs data have boosted the rate cut hopes.    Indian IT companies derive a major portion of their revenues from US market. A rate cut by the American central bank will likely boost US discretionary demand, which in turn may benefit the IT firms.    Coforge shares dropped over 1.5 percent to trade at Rs 1,812 apiece, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Persistent Systems shares dropped around 1 percent each. Infosys and Mphasis shares meanwhile fell over around 0.5 percent each.    HCL Tech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra and LTI Mindtree shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.    &quot;Going forward, in the absence of any major domestic triggers, it will be crucial to stay vigilant for global developments, as Fed policy is around the corner, and key developments could act as a catalyst in setting an intermediate tone for equity markets. Furthermore, it is advisable to exercise vigilance and implement effective risk management strategies given the current market landscape,&quot; said by Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivative at Angel One, about the overall market.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank  We met Mr Subrat Mohanty, Executive Director and Mr Puneet Sharma, CFO of Axis Bank (Axis). The bank did not provide any guidance, though it acknowledges the healthy systemic liquidity; this, in conjunction with the hefty cumulative cut, should aid systemic loan growth, albeit with a lag. Credit card stress appears to be levelling off; PLs though, may exhibit some latency \u2013 potentially stabilising in the next two quarters. We highlight that relative to peers, the bank has delivered soft deposits/loan growth, though NII growth outcomes (FY25 growth of ~9% YoY) have been similar. We reckon, Axis is a key beneficiary of the easing liquidity and peaking unsecured stress. We see a soft H1FY26, restrained by sluggish NIM (more so in Q2FY26) and elevated credit costs (further internal tightening, seasonality and absence of SR reversals). However, we believe H2FY26 shall offer a better picture on growth and RoA. Maintain BUY given attractive valuations of ~1.45x FY27 core banking book.  Outlook  Overall, Axis is likely to be a key beneficiary of easing liquidity and peaking systemic stress in unsecured retail. Our estimates are broadly unchanged. We see a soft H1FY26 due to pressure in NIM and frontloaded credit costs, but a potentially healthy improvement in H2FY26. As against the muted EPS growth in FY26, we see strong double-digits growth for FY27E led by a NIM uptick and easing credit costs. Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP of INR 1,470, valuing the stock at ~1.8x core banking ABV.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices bounced back with a 1.29 percent rally on June 20, snapping a three-day losing streak. Market breadth turned positive, with 1,755 shares advancing compared to 828 shares that saw a correction on the NSE. The sustainability of these gains is the key factor to watch in the upcoming sessions, as the Iran-Israel conflict and global cues could lead to volatility and consolidation in the near term. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    Indus Towers | CMP: Rs 404.3        With Friday's strong close, Indus Towers has decisively surpassed its past three months\u2019 down-sloping trendline resistance at Rs 398 on a closing basis, confirming bullish sentiment. This breakout is accompanied by huge volumes, signifying increased participation. The daily Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The stock is well-placed above its 20, 50, and 100-day SMAs, which reconfirms a bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators point to rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 425, Rs 444    Stop-Loss: Rs 398    Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,169.8        Kotak Mahindra Bank is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms across all time frames. The stock is well-placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, and these averages are also inching up along with prices, reconfirming the bullish trend. The stock is strongly sustaining above its multi-year resistance zone of Rs 2,055, which reconfirms bullish sentiment. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators suggest rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,255, Rs 2,320    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,130    NRB Bearings | CMP: Rs 290.2        On the weekly chart, NRB Bearings has witnessed a breakout from a one-year down-sloping trendline on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by high volumes, signifying increased participation. The stock is well-placed above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, which are also trending upward with prices, reaffirming a bullish trend. The daily and weekly Bollinger Bands buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators show rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 315, Rs 345    Stop-Loss: Rs 280    Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One    ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 1,971        ICICI Lombard General Insurance has shown impressive growth over the past couple of months, following a cycle of higher highs and higher lows. This surge has been supported by several key developments, beginning with a rounding base formation and a breakout above the 200-day SMA\u2014suggesting building market interest and a potential trend reversal. Additionally, the 14-day RSI shows a positive crossover, adding a bullish note. These technical indicators suggest that ICICI Lombard General Insurance may be entering a period of sustained growth, making it an attractive option for investors. We recommend buying the stock on dips around Rs 1,950\u20131,940.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,100    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,860    KFin Technologies | CMP: Rs 1,272.5        KFin Technologies has seen a decent move after a consolidation phase and is now trading above all key EMAs and the 200-day SMA. The recent buying traction has been backed by rising trading volumes, attributed to positive developments. The counter has also formed a higher low on the daily chart and is positioned above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent fall\u2014adding to the bullish outlook. Technical indicators align with the positive momentum, suggesting further upside potential. We recommend buying KFin Technologies on dips around Rs 1,250\u20131,230.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,380    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,160    Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,184.4        Mahindra and Mahindra has experienced a gradual resurgence over recent trading sessions, culminating in a strong weekly close. The stock is firmly positioned above all its short-term EMAs on the daily timeframe after an extended period, indicating inherent strength. It has also witnessed a breakout from a sloping trendline during its consolidation phase, backed by a positive crossover on the 14-day RSI. These factors support a bullish outlook. We recommend buying M&amp;amp;M around Rs 3,150\u20133,120.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,340, Rs 3,380    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,020    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    TVS Motor Company | CMP: Rs 2,812.1        TVS Motor is on the verge of a bullish breakout on the daily chart, forming a 169-day-long cup-and-handle pattern. While the cup formation was broad, the handle has been exceptionally tight, with ideal volume behaviour\u2014lower on down days and higher on up days. The pattern is maturing, with short-term weekly EMAs having caught up. The last 8\u20139 weeks have shown tight weekly closes. A breakout above Rs 2,840 could propel the stock toward Rs 3,200.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,050, Rs 3,200    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,700    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises | CMP: Rs 7,063.5        Apollo Hospitals is forming a flag-like pattern on the daily chart, resembling a rounding formation. Following a sharp, pole-like upmove, the flag has allowed short-term weekly moving averages to catch up, setting the stage for a potential breakout. A move above Rs 7,100 appears highly likely, but confirmation will require strong volumes. The current consolidation has occurred on below-average volumes, which is typical; however, the loose structure requires a high-volume breakout to validate a sustained uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: 7,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 6,900    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries is the only Indian firm to have made it to the listing of top 30 publicly traded global technology companies, as per a 340-page report, titled \u2019Trends \u2013 Artificial Intelligence\u2019, that delves into the rapid global adoption and transformative impact of AI technologies.    The report lists global technology companies by market capitalisation. Top eight slots on the list are occupied by US technology giants \u2013 Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla and Broadcom. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC is ranked 9th, followed by China\u2019s Tencent. Reliance, with a market capitalisation of USD 216 billion, is ranked 23rd, according to the list. \u201dOver the past 30 years (1995-2025), just five companies remained on the top 30 most highly valued publicly traded global technology companies \u2013 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, IBM and AT&amp;amp;T,\u201d the report said.    It went on to list Reliance alongside the likes of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, Alibaba, Salesforce and China Mobile as the new entrants. \u201dIn 1995, the USA had 53 per cent (16 of 30) of the most valuable tech companies and 70 per cent (21 of 30) in 2025,\u201d it said. In 1995, Japan had 30 per cent (9 of 30) of top tech companies and zero in 2025. The UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Mexico and Malaysia had 1 each, but now none are on the list. \u201dIn 2025, new geographic entrants include China with 3, Germany with 2, Taiwan with 1, Netherlands with 1, South Korea with 1 and India with 1,\u201d it said.    Taiwan has only one company on the list \u2013 TSMC \u2013 the company produces 80-90 per cent of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors and 62 per cent of global semiconductors. According to the report, India has the most number of ChatGPT mobile app users in the world. It accounts for 13.5 per cent of monthly active users of the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is ahead of the USA (8.9 per cent), Indonesia (5.7 per cent) and Brazil (5.4 per cent). Pakistan has 3 per cent of users.    India also accounts for 6.9 per cent of active global users of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, behind China (33.9 per cent) and Russia (9.2 per cent). \u201dArtificial intelligence is reshaping the modern landscape at breakneck speed. What began as research has scaled into emerging core infrastructure across industries \u2013 powering everything from customer support to software development, scientific discovery, education, and manufacturing,\u201d the report said.    AI, it said, is accelerating, touching more domains, and becoming more embedded in how work gets done. \u201dCatalysing this growth is the global availability of easy-to-use multimodal AI tools (like ChatGPT) on pervasive mobile devices, augmented by a steep decline in inference costs and an explosion in model availability. Both closed and open-source tools are now widely accessible and increasingly capable, enabling solo developers, startups, and enterprises alike to experiment and deploy with minimal friction,\u201d it said. Large tech incumbents are weaving AI deeper into their products \u2013 rolling out copilots, assistants, and even agents that reframe how users engage with technology.    Whether through embedded intelligence in SaaS or agentic workflows in consumer apps, the interface layer is being rewritten in real time. On the compute side, investment continues to scale dramatically. Capital expenditures across major cloud providers, chipmakers, and hyperscalers have hit new highs, driven by the race to enable real-time, high-volume inference at scale.    The investment is not just in chips, but also in new data centres, networking infrastructure, and energy systems to support growing demand. \u201dWhether this level of capital expenditure persists remains to be seen, but as AI moves closer to the edge \u2013 in vehicles, farms, labs, and homes \u2013 distinction between digital and physical infrastructure continues to blur,\u201d the report said.

Despite price erosion in gRevlimid, it posted a 156bps YoY (+133bps QoQ) surge in gross margin to 68.8%. US sales at USD 226mn were better than anticipated led by higher volumes for gRevlimid and launch of Abraxane and Nilotinib in Q1. India biz growth was slow at 6% YoY due to overall slowdown in acute (~58% of Cipla India biz) market. As gRevlimid sales start tapering in the next few months, key respiratory assets like gAbraxane, gAdvair (H2FY26 launch), peptides (FY26) and gSymbicort (FY27) could offset the impact and help Cipla\u2019s US sales touch the USD 1bn mark in FY27. Management maintains EBITDA margin guidance of 23.5-24.5% for FY26. Retain BUY with an unchanged TP of INR 1,800 based on 26x FY27E EPS.

Pantoon Services will now coordinate with more than two dozen vendors, ensuring do not have direct contact with the TCS' resource management group (RMG), which includes officials involved in hiring and placing candidates from staffing firms on contract, the report said.    The move is aimed at boosting transparency in the recruitment process, although vendors have expressed dissatisfaction. TCS' openings for contract workers will now be placed on Pontoon's platform, where the vendors will submit their candidates' profiles, after which Pontoon will conduct the first level of screening and then TCS will take the final call, the report said.    Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report.    Unnamed executives from staffing firms told the news publication that they have been engaging with Pontoon over the past two months and are no longer allowed to contact TCS for updates or clarifications.    TCS will continue to hire candidates for full-time positions through campus placements and through its internal HR, the report added. The contract workers are mostly hired for up to a year and remain on the staffing vendors' payroll. The vendors are paid between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1 lakh for every successful contract placement.

At 9.18 a.m., shares of TCS were quoting Rs 3,088.9, lower by 1.5 percent on the NSE.    The job cuts will impact middle and senior level employees the most apart from some of the entry level associates who have been on the bench for a long time.    However, brokerages were not a fan of the move. International brokerage Jefferies noted that the plan to trim the workforce might lead to near-term execution slippages and higher long-term attrition. Going ahead, cost optimisation and AI-led productivity will drive most deal wins, and firms that are unable to gain market-share will have to resort to layoffs.    During this turbulent period for the domestic IT services sector, Jefferies prefers Infosys and HCLTech in the large-cap space, while Coforge and Mphasis are its picks in the mid-cap IT segment.    Global broking house Citi Research maintained its 'sell' call, with a target price of Rs 3,135 on TCS shares following the update. The brokerage noted that TCS' earnings for the quarter ended June indicate sluggishness in its core markets, and its margin and cash flow trends need to be monitored.    Also Read | Had to take 'difficult call' to build stronger TCS, says CEO K Krithivasan after cutting 12,000 jobs    TCS will be providing notice period pay and an added severance package to impacted employees, it will also look to extend insurance benefits and offer outplacement opportunities.    The layoffs won\u2019t be geography or domain specific and will be concluded over the next three quarters of FY26. This comes a few weeks after the IT services behemoth updated its HR policy by mandating employees to have 225 days of billability in a year and limiting bench time to up to 35 days.

HUVR is adopting aggressive strategy to accelerate growth by 1) price cuts and new launches in laundry portfolio 2) re-launch of Boost and plans to significantly re-launch Horlicks to arrest sales decline 3) sustained investments behind Future Core &amp;amp; Market Makers, part of portfolio which are growing in double digits. HUVR is making a big push in premium segments in Beauty and wellbeing to regain lost ground by B2C acquisitions and new launches and brand extensions, which should start showing impact by end of 1H26. Recent acquisitions are on track as OZiva sales are 3x in 1 year while Minimalist sales have grown in double digits since acquisition.    Outlook  We expect volume/sales and margins to inch up gradually in coming quarters with expected PAT growth exit of FY26 in high single digits. We expect 5.6% Sales CAGR and 4% EPS CAGR over FY25-27. We assign DCF based target price of Rs2686 (Rs2601 earlier) as we roll forward to Jun\u201927, implying target PE of 55.6x JuneFY27 EPS.

        "Title": "Hindustan Unilever Q1 Preview: Profit likely to remain flat as margins may see sharp contraction",
        "Date": "2025-07-30",
        "Description": "Hindustan Unilever will report its results for the quarter ended June on July 31, 2025. Revenue and profit growth is likely to be muted.",
        "Author": "Zoya Springwala",
        "Content": "One of India\u2019s largest consumer staples firm Hindustan Unilever Ltd. is set to report its earnings for the first quarter of the the current fiscal year on July 31, 2025. Rising commodity prices, increased competition, and lagging urban demand are expected to result in the FMCG giant seeing tepid earnings for the quarter.    According to a Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report revenue growth in low single-digits, higher by 4 percent on-year, at Rs 16,014 crore, as against Rs 15,339 crore in the June quarter of the previous year. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,557 crore, down 0.4 percent from Rs 2,572 crore from the corresponding quarter last year.        Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees HUL\u2019s net profit rising 1.6 percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection, rolled out by Kotak Institutional Equities, suggests that net profit might fall 2.2 percent YoY.    What factors are impacting the earnings?    Volumes    Hindustan Unilever\u2019s revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, as urban demand sees significant stress.    Brokerages noted that demand trends remained consistent QoQ with muted growth, and rural areas continued to outperform urban areas. &quot;There have not been any change in urban/rural demand versus last quarter. We expect Q1 to be largely in line with management's guidance on Q4 call,&quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities.    Segmental performance    According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the Home Care (HC)s segment's growth will clock in at 2.5 percent year-on-year (versus 1.8 percent in Q4), as volume growth will be offset by negative pricing and higher promotional intensity. &quot;In Home Care, negative pricing for the entire quarter is likely versus one month of negative pricing in Q4FY25. However, we do see this Home Care price intervention as a driver of volume growth,&quot; added Nuvama Institutional Equities.    Beauty &amp;amp; Personal Care (BPC) revenues will see 5 percent year-on-year (versus 3.7 percent in Q4), aided by price hikes in soaps. The Foods &amp;amp; Refreshments (F&amp;amp;R) segment may report 2.8 percent growth (versus a 0.4 percent decline in Q4), driven by price hikes in tea.    Margins    According to expectations, gross margins are likely to contract as a result of increasing consumer protection. Brokerages project that advertising and promotional spends will be up to 11 percent of sales in the quarter.    This impact will flow through to the EBITDA, leading to an EBITDA margin contraction. While Moneycontrol's estimate suggests EBITDA margin may contact 90 basis points, the range is between 70-110 basis points of contraction.    What to look out for in the quarterly show?    The key focus will be on HUL's growth outlook, and experts will be watching closely for commentary on inflation and pricing outlook in both soaps and tea. Additionally, demand recovery in urban consumption will be eyed.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank  Axis Bank (Axis) reported ~13% rise in Q4FY25 net profit to INR 71.2bn (flattish YoY; 8% beat) on the back of ~2% rise in PPOP (in-line). Provisions declined sharply, led by INR 8bn reversals on government-backed SR. Reported RoA was strong at ~1.8%. Business growth YoY remained muted (and below system), though QoQ growth saw a seasonal rebound. Reported NIM improved 4bps QoQ to 3.97% while calculated NIM dipped 7bps QoQ. Axis acknowledged easing systemic liquidity and performance of new vintage, but did not provide quantitative guidance on growth or credit costs. There is a slight change in commentary on the normalisation of stress in personal loan and credit cards. In the current rate cycle (FY22\u201325), Axis has registered relatively slower deposits growth (~12.6% CAGR), prioritising quality (improvement in run-off rates, contained dip in CASA share) and pricing (modest rise in cost of funding).    Outlook  We estimate the bank to deliver ~1.6% RoA in FY26 (similar for FY27) vs. ~1.7% in FY25 with a slight dip in NIM, partly offset by opex and stable credit costs. Maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 1,400 (prior: INR 1,320), valuing the core banking business at ~1.7x FY27E core banking book (1.6x) and INR 133/share for subsidiaries.

        "Date": "2025-04-25",
        "Description": "Reliance Industries had a strong performance for the full financial year 2024-25 with record consolidated revenue at Rs 10.71 lakh crore, growing 7.1 percent YoY as well as record EBITDA at Rs 1.83 lakh crore, up 2.9 percent over the previous fiscal.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries ---the first Indian company to cross the Rs 10 lakh crore mark in terms of net worth--- recorded double-digit growth in the telecom and retail segments for the quarter ended March 2025, which both boosted the overall topline as well as bottomline of the company.    Meanwhile, the full year gone by saw a steady financial performance given company's focus on operational discipline, customer-centric innovation and fulfilling India\u2019s growth requirements, said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director.    He further said FY2025 has been a challenging year in terms of the global business environment, with weak macro-economic conditions and a shifting geo-political landscape.    Here are 10 key important highlights from the earnings:    1) Profit    Reliance reported profit at Rs 22,611 crore for the March 2025 quarter, growing 6.4 percent over the corresponding period of the previous financial year.    However, tax expenses during the same period increased by 1.4 percent YoY to Rs 6,669 crore, the company said in its filing to the exchanges.    2) Topline    Revenue for final quarter of FY25 at Rs 2.88 lakh crore grew by 8.8 percent compared to the same period of the previous fiscal, thanks to the double-digit growth in digital, retail and oil-to-chemicals segments.    3) Operating Performance    Its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) increased by 3.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 48,737 crore during Q4FY25, backed by robust growth in Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail.    However, the EBITDA margin for the quarter came in at 16.9 percent, compared to 17.8 percent in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.    Reliance said depreciation was steady at Rs 13,479 crore, declining 0.7 percent YoY. However, finance cost increased by 6.8% YoY to Rs 6,155 crore, primarily due to higher average liability balances.    4) Jio Platforms    Jio Platforms continued to report strong numbers with profit growing 25.8 percent YoY to Rs 7,023 crore and revenue soaring 17.8 percent to Rs 39,853 crore in the fourth quarter of FY25.    &quot;Operating revenue growth was driven by impact of tariff revisions for mobility services, and growth in homes and digital services businesses,&quot; Reliance said.    EBITDA during the quarter grew by 18.5 percent YoY to Rs 17,016 crore driven by healthy revenue growth and margin improvement (of 40 bps YoY).    Jio, which had total subscriber base of over 48.8 crore, recorded another quarter of healthy improvement in ARPU (average revenue per user) to Rs 206.2 due to flow through of tariff hike, up 13.5 percent YoY and 1.4 percent QoQ.    5) Reliance Retail    Reliance Retail Ventures has registered a 30.4 percent on-year growth in profit at Rs 3,519 crore, and a 15.7 percent increase in revenue at Rs 88,620 crore for the quarter ended March 2025, with growth across consumption baskets.    EBITDA for the quarter jumped 14.3 percent YoY to Rs 6,711 crore with improved operational efficiencies and superior store operating metrics. Margin stood at 8.5 percent against 8.7 percent during the same period.    Reliance Retail had 19,340 stores at the end of March 2025, increasing from 18,836 stores as of March 2024.    6) Oil-To-Chemical (O2C)    The O2C segment registered a 15.4 percent YoY growth in revenue to Rs 1.64 lakh crore for the March 2025 quarter due to increased volumes and broader domestic product footprint, with exports growing 2.2 percent to Rs 73,749 crore.    EBITDA for the segment in the same period decreased by 10 percent to Rs 15,080 crore due to a sharp fall in transportation fuel cracks and lower polyester chain margins partially offset by higher volume, feedstock cost optimization and higher PP and PVC delta.    Total throughput increased by 2.5 percent YoY to 20.3 MMT, and production meant for sale grew by 4.7 percent to 17.9 MMT during the quarter.    7) Oil &amp;amp; Gas    Oil and gas segment revenue declined by 0.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,440 crore due to lower gas production and lower oil offtake from KGD6, partly offset by higher gas price realisation in KGD6 field and higher CBM production.    &quot;The average price realized for KGD6 gas was $10.09 per MMBTU in Q4FY25 against $9.53 per MMBTU in Q4FY24. The average price realised for CBM gas was $10.36 per MMBTU against $14.34 per MMBTU during the same period,&quot; Reliance said.    The segment's EBITDA dropped by 8.6 percent in the same period to Rs 5,123 crore on higher operating cost due to onetime maintenance activity and a natural decline in KGD6 volumes.    Its KGD6 production for the quarter at 63.7 BCFe (billions of cubic feet equivalent) decreased by 10.8 percent and CBM production at 2.7 BCFe surged by 28.6 percent compared to same period previous fiscal.    8) FY25 Performance    Reliance had a strong performance for the full financial year 2024-25 with record consolidated revenue at Rs 10.71 lakh crore, growing 7.1 percent YoY as well as record EBITDA at Rs 1.83 lakh crore, up 2.9 percent over the previous fiscal.    During FY25, &quot;we have laid a strong foundation for our projects in renewable energy and battery operations. In the coming quarters, we will see the transition of this business from incubation to operationalisation,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said.    He firmly believes that the New Energy growth engine will create significant value for Reliance, for India and for the world.    Consolidated profit of the company for the fiscal FY25 at Rs 81,309 crore increased by 2.9 percent YoY, however, EBITDA margin during the year was 17.1 percent compared to 17.8 percent in the previous year.    9) JioStar Business    The JioStar business recorded profit of Rs 229 crore for the fiscal 2025 on revenue of Rs 10,006 crore, with EBITDA of Rs 774 crore.    Reliance said JioHotstar served 503 million MAUs in March 2025 driven by key sporting events such as ICC Champions Trophy, IPL and India\u2019s largest digital content library of greater than 320K hours.    JioStar TV network occupied 34 percent market share across TV Entertainment and reached over 76 crore monthly viewers across the country, it added.    10) Dividend, Fund Raising, Capex    Reliance Industries has announced dividend of Rs 5.5 per share for the financial year ended March 2025.    Meanwhile, the Board has approved raising of funds through issuance of non-convertible debentures up to Rs 25,000 crore, in one or more tranches, on private placement basis.    The capital expenditure for the quarter ended March 2025 was Rs 36,041 crore, compared to Rs 23,207 crore in March 2024 quarter while for the full year, its capital expenditure was at Rs 1,31,107 crore against Rs 1,31,769 crore in the previous fiscal.    Reliance said the cash &amp;amp; cash equivalents in FY25 was Rs 2.3 lakh crore against Rs 2.08 lakh crore in FY24. Net debt as of March 2025 stood at Rs 1.17 lakh crore compared to Rs 1.16 lakh crore at the end of March 2024.    Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

        "Title": "PSUs should find a place in investors' portfolios; SBI, BEL, Coal India among top picks: Motilal Oswal",
        "Date": "2025-06-26",
        "Description": "Motilal Oswal said that several PSU sectors have posted a very sharp turnaround in profit and creating unexpected shareholder value. ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Public sector enterprises (PSUs) were known for their sluggish growth, debt-laden balance sheets, and poor performance. However, since the COVD-19 pandemic, Indian PSUs have been one of the most remarkable stories of Indian capital markets, noted domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal.    Several PSU sectors have posted a very sharp turnaround in profit and creating unexpected shareholder value. As a cohort, the PSUs posted an unprecedented 36 percent profit after tax (PAT) CAGR during FY20-25, feeding into the 32 percent CAGR for the BSE PSU Index and a consistent expansion in PSUs\u2019 share in overall profits to an impressive 38 percent.    However, after a remarkable post-pandemic rebound, PSU earnings growth moderated in FY25, weighed down by the high base of a robust 43 percent YoY increase in FY24 and a decline in O&amp;amp;G sector earnings.    &quot;While some cyclical moderation did set in in FY25, key building blocks and an enabling environment for sustained profitable performance for several PSUs look intact. Consequently, PSU names in sectors with policy/demand tailwinds or structural growth potential should find a meaningful place in long-term investor portfolios, in our view,&quot; said the brokerage.    The brokerage said its top PSU ideas are State Bank of India Ltd, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, and Coal India Ltd.    For the brokerage's PSU coverage universe, it sees a 10 percent PAT CAGR over FY25-27, primarily driven by the BFSI and O&amp;amp;G sectors, based on conservative assumptions relative to the FY25 base. &quot;Logistics, Capital Goods, and Metals are also expected to contribute positively. Incremental profit growth is likely to be led by BFSI (53 percent), followed by O&amp;amp;G (20 percent) and Metals (12 percent),&quot; added the report.    Follow our market blog to catch all the live updates    Further, the brokerage noted that over the past year, the market capitalization of the BSE PSU Index hit an all-time high of Rs 74 lakh crore in July 2024, driven by consistent rerating trends. It then declined by 31 percent to Rs 51 lakh crore in February 2025 amid the broad market correction before recovering 25 percent to Rs 64 lakh crore in June 2025.    The index\u2019s current market capitalization stands 14 percent below its all-time high (up 5 percent in  the year 2025 so far). Owing to the market correction (between October 2024 and March 2025), the  P/E ratio of the BSE PSU Index has come down to 11.7x, from 13.8x in July 2024, though it is up from 9.8x in February 2025.

        "Content": "The Rs 25,000-crore qualified institutional placement (QIP) of India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) saw very strong investor interest, being subscribed three-times its offer size in less than a day, CNBC-Awaaz reported on July 17.    The PSU lender had launched its QIP in the second half of July 16 at a floor price of Rs 811.05 apiece, at a slight discount of the last traded price. The fundraise is expected to help SBI\u2019s loan growth and strengthen the balance sheet. This is the first time since 2017 that SBI has tapped the equity market to raise capital.    The QIP has received bids for Rs 75,000 crore worth of shares as against its offer size of Rs 25,000 crore, said CNBC Awaaz. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the anchor investor for the QIP, led the subscription race among domestic fund houses by bidding for shares worth Rs 7,000 crore. Quant Mutual Fund followed, by bidding for Rs 3,000 crore shares. HDFC Pension Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund and Birla Mutual Fund have also strongly participated.    Among the FIIs, Nomura has bid for Rs 1,800 crore worth of shares while Marshall Wace and Millennium bid for Rs 1,500 crore shares each, it further said.

In May 2025, the bank said it received its board approval to raise equity capital aggregating up to Rs 25,000 crore in one or more tranches during FY2026 through QIP/ follow-on public offer (FPO) or any other permitted mode.    The QIP is part of SBI's broader plans to support loan growth, strengthen its balance sheet and meet regulatory requirements. It\u2019s also the first time since 2017 that the lender, majority owned by the government, tapped the equity market.    SBI has shortlisted six investment banks to manage the transaction, including the Indian arms of Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc, as well as ICICI Securities Ltd., Kotak Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley, and SBI Capital Markets Ltd., Bloomberg News reported earlier.    The state-owned bank had last tapped the QIP route in the financial year 2017-18 (Apr-Mar), raising Rs 15,000 crore.    SBI shares were hovering in the green with marginal gains at Rs 835.75 apiece on July 17.",

This comes amid a significant downturn in the market.    TCS shares were trading at a volume over 3 percent higher than their 10-day average. Meanwhile, HCL Tech shares were trading at a volume nearly 2.49 times higher than their 10-day average. Both the stocks saw a strong decline in share prices. HCL Tech shares were trading nearly 4 percent lower at Rs 1,638 apiece, while those of TCS were down 3 percent to trade at Rs 3,680 apiece. Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) stock also saw strong volumes, higher than its 10-day average. The stock dropped over 1 percent to trade at Rs 3,270 per share.    This comes as the IT stocks continue to see strong selling pressure amid concerns surrounding US's slowing economy. Domestic IT firms that are reliant on services exports to US bore the highest brunt of the losses.    While IT stocks tumbled over selling pressure, auto stocks saw a strong surge in volumes amid rising interest, as concerns over Elon Musk's Tesla disrupting the Indian market eased. Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra (M&amp;amp;M) shares saw trading volumes higher than its 10-day average. The stock remains the top gainer on Sensex, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,713 per share.    Bajaj Finserv and Tata Steel also saw strong trading volumes.

        "Content": "The shares of several oil marketing companies (OMC) and oil &amp;amp; gas firms strongly gained on June 11 as falling oil prices boosted investor sentiment on hopes for better margins. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Oil &amp;amp; Gas index up nearly 1.7 percent in the morning. Also, what boosted the oil &amp;amp; gas stocks is that an US body sees oil prices falling near-term.    The US Energy Information Administration sees oil prices falling in the near term due to a rise in global inventories. The organisation sees Brent crude oil falling to $61 per barrel by end of 2025 from $64 per barrel in May, and averaging $59 per barrel in 2026.    Oil prices softened on June 11 as investors assessed the impact of US-China trade talks, which were held in London, and are yet to be reviewed by US President Donald Trump. Weak demand from China and lower OPEC+ production continued to weigh on the oil prices.    Brent Crude futures dropped 0.3 percent to trade at $66.680 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.3 percent to $64.82 per barrel, according to data cited by Reuters. Investors now await US President Donald Trump's announcement of the outcome of the trade talks.    Additionally, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) decided to gradually increase production, a move seen as favourable for India's refiners as it improves their gross marketing margins on retail fuel.    Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) shares jumped nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 421 apiece and Rs 332 apiece respectively. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shares meanwhile gained 2.5 percent to hover around Rs 146 apiece.    Reliance Industries shares meanwhile jumped around 1.6 percent to trade at Rs 1,461 apiece, thus hitting their eight-month high. Notably, the shares of India's most valuable company were the top gainer on the benchmark index Sensex. ONGC was the top Nifty gainer on June 11 by rising 2%.    Oil India shares also made significant gains, rising nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 449 apiece. Notably, falling oil prices were likely to negatively impact the stock. However, the shares may have been boosted after Avendus Spark initiated a 'Buy' call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 630 per share. This implies a strong upside potential of over 44 percent from the stock\u2019s previous closing price of Rs 437 per share.    Oil prices have consistently been under $70 per barrel since the start of April amid concerns over production hikes by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies.

        "Description": "IT stocks: The Nifty IT index dropped over 1.3%, snapping a six-day gaining streak. It is currently the top loser among all the sectoral indices on NSE.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The shares of major IT players dropped on June 12 after uncertain US tariff rules and geopolitical tensions spooked investors. The Nifty IT index dropped over 1.3 percent to hover around 38,354, snapping a six-day gaining streak.    The IT index is currently the top loser among all the sectoral indices on NSE.    Persistent Systems and Infosys shares dropped nearly 2 percent each to trade at Rs 5,865 apiece and Rs 1,604 apiece respectively. Coforge and HCL Tech shares were meanwhile trading over 1.4 percent lower each. Mphasis, Tech Mahindra and Wipro shares were nearly 1 percent down, while those of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and LTI Mindtree were trading with marginal losses.    Here are the key factors that are affect the IT stocks today:    Donald Trump says unilateral tariff rates to be set in two weeks    US President Donald Trump on June 11 said he will set unilateral tariff rates within two weeks. &quot;At a certain point, we're just going to send letters out. And I think you understand that, saying this is the deal, you can take it or leave it,&quot; Trump told reporters on June 11. This may have spooked investors on concerns of rising inflationary pressures on the American economy as the countries may retaliate with counter tariffs.    Iran threatened to target US military bases:    Iran threatened to target US military bases in the region if conflict breaks out, while President Donald Trump said he was &quot;less confident&quot; about reaching a nuclear deal.    &quot;All its bases are within our reach, we have access to them, and without hesitation we will target all of them in the host countries,&quot; Iran's Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said in response to US threats of military action if the talks fail.    Notably, Indian IT companies derive a major portion of their revenue from American economy. The rising inflationary concerns and geopolitical tensions are likely to negatively impact their stocks.    IT stocks had seen a sharp rise immediately after markets opened over multiple factors. US President Donald Trump announced that the trade deal between US and China is &quot;done&quot;. Further, softer than expected May inflation data further boosted investor sentiment.    US CPI inflation data:    US consumer prices increased less than what was expected in May, according to the latest report released by the country\u2019s Labor Department on June 11. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.1 percent in May, lower than the 0.2 percent increase in April. Notably, May\u2019s data is lower than the 0.2 percent CPI estimated by Economists polled by Reuters.    This comes after Trump\u2019s severe tariffs had increased fears of severe inflation, and a possible recession as a result. While the CPI cooled down in May, analysts estimate that the tariffs may hike inflation gradually over the months.    Trump says US-China trade deal is done:    US President Donald Trump took to social media on June 11 to announce that US has finalized a new deal with China. &quot;We are getting a total of 55% tariffs, China is getting 10%.&quot; The details of the tariff arrangement are yet to be explained and understood,\u201d he wrote in a post on Truth Social.        However, when reports asked Trump on June 11 if he would extend the deadline for nations to set deals with US, he said he will be open to it. &quot;But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna have that necessity,&quot; he added.    &quot;The tariff crisis is not over yet. With Trump's credibility being what it is, it would be too early to discount the development as a positive for markets,&quot; said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Investments.

        "Content": "Reliance Industries Ltd\u2019s (RIL\u2019s) shares jumped over five in trade on Monday, April 28 to emerge as the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index, after the Mukesh Ambani-led company beat earnings estimates for the fiscal quarter ended March. At close, shares of Reliance Industries were 5.07 percent higher, to settle at Rs 1,336.30 apiece on the NSE, marking its biggest single-day gain since June 3, 2024.    The company's net profit attributable to shareholders grew 2.4 percent to Rs 19,407 crore for Q4 FY25, beating Street expectations, as a result of lower depreciation, interest and tax rate. Revenue for the three months ended March 31 climbed 8.8 percent from a year ago to Rs 2.88 lakh crore, driven by company\u2019s digital services, retail and oil-to-chemicals business.    Brokerages hiked their target prices on the Nifty 50 heavyweight following its March quarter earnings report, as a result of its robust performance across segments and higher-than-anticipated results for the O2C segment.    At 2.30 pm, shares of Reliance Industries surged 5.1 percent to quote Rs 1,367.7 apiece on the NSE, marking its biggest single-day gain since June 3, 2024.    Follow our market blog to catch all the updates    The bullishness on RIL shares was largely driven by the telecommunication arm Reliance Jio. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said, segment-wise, it expects Jio to be the biggest growth driver with 21 percent annual EBITDA growth over FY25-27, driven by one more tariff hike, market share gains in wireless, and ramp-up of the homes and enterprise business.        Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings noted a few key triggers which will drive growth for Reliance Industries in the near term: scale-up of the new energy business, upcoming tariff hikes for Jio, and potential IPO/listing for Jio, which will drive value-unlocking for RIL.    \u201cAdditionally, with the completion of streamlining of operations at Reliance Retail, the retail business will sustain a healthy growth trajectory,\u201d Nomura said.    JPMorgan also noted the sharp acceleration of Reliance Retail\u2019s growth in Q4, jumping 16 percent year-on-year. The brokerage noted, with favourable valuations, that this could contribute to the share price in the near term.    On the new energy front, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates that the PAT share could jump to 12 percent by FY2030, especially given the management\u2019s expectations of the new energy segment equaling the O2C segment\u2019s profit by FY2031. Further, the brokerage said that new energy should add over 50 per cent of current additions to the consolidated net profit amid the higher value afforded to \u2018clean\u2019 technology.    \u201cOverall, we build in a CAGR of ~13-14 percent in consolidated EBITDA and PAT over FY25-27, driven by a double-digit EBITDA CAGR in RJio and Retail. After a subdued FY25, we expect earnings to recover in the O2C segment, driven by improvement in refining margins,\u201d Motilal Oswal said.

        "Date": "2025-06-17",
        "Description": "The market is likely to maintain a positive bias in the upcoming session. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmarks shrugged off the Israel-Iran conflict and gained nearly 1 percent on June 16, snapping a two-day fall. The market breadth was slightly positive, with 1,366 shares advancing and 1,232 shares declining on the NSE. The market is likely to maintain a positive bias in the upcoming session. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Route Mobile | CMP: Rs 1,062.2        Recently, Route Mobile broke out after nearly a month of consolidation, accompanied by a significant surge in volume\u2014indicating strong accumulation. This consolidation phase is notable as it occurred within the R3\u2013S3 zone of the monthly Camarilla pivots, establishing an Inside Value relationship. This setup forms when the current month\u2019s pivots are nested within the previous month\u2019s range, often signaling a potential breakout with strong directional bias.    Adding to the bullish case, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) has consistently held above the 60 level and is now positioned at 64, reflecting strengthening momentum. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,065\u2013Rs 1,050 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,180    Stop-Loss: Rs 995    Biocon | CMP: Rs 357.3        Biocon recently broke out of a consolidation zone between Rs 330\u2013345 and is now trading well above it, signaling renewed strength. On the monthly floor pivot, an Inside Value relationship between May and June (R1\u2013S1) suggests potential for an explosive move.    The breakout was supported by a volume surge and a breach of the short-term falling trendline, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Additionally, the RSI held steady in the 40\u201350 range during consolidation and now hovers around 65. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 358\u2013Rs 353 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 390    Stop-Loss: Rs 337    Swiggy | CMP: Rs 360.95        Swiggy recently broke out of a falling channel and touched Rs 376, indicating bullish momentum. Over the past five sessions, it has seen mild correction but found support at the monthly R3 Camarilla pivot. Notably, the stock had consolidated between R3 and S3 pivots from March to May, a setup that often precedes strong directional moves. This technical structure suggests potential for further upside. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 363\u2013Rs 355 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 390    Stop-Loss: Rs 340    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Kotak Mahindra Bank | CMP: Rs 2,139        Kotak Mahindra Bank recently provided a breakout from a multi-year consolidation and has now witnessed long build-up, suggesting that the short- to medium-term outlook for the stock is positive.    Although the stock has a higher Call base at Rs 2,160, it has witnessed Call unwinding at almost all other strikes, increasing the probability of an upside. It is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels, which suggests a positive short-term outlook. Traders may consider buying Kotak Bank Futures in the Rs 2,150 to Rs 2,130 range.    Strategy: Buy    Targets: Rs 2,200, Rs 2,250    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,090    Apollo Hospitals Enterprise | CMP: Rs 7,114        Apollo Hospitals Enterprise seems to be breaking its range on the upside, supported by long additions in the futures, indicating a higher probability of upward movement.    Although the stock has high Call bases from Rs 7,100 to Rs 7,300, with a maximum at Rs 7,200, Call unwinding at lower levels, coupled with Put additions and a range breakout on the upside, may trigger short covering in the Calls, leading to further upward momentum. The stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels. Traders may initiate long positions in the Rs 7,140 to Rs 7,110 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 7,300, Rs 7,400    Stop-Loss: Rs 7,000    Tata Consultancy Services | CMP: Rs 3,496.3        The Nifty IT index has bounced back significantly over the past couple of months and has even outperformed the Nifty Bank, indicating overall strength in the near term. TCS witnessed short build-up in its previous fall, and there has not been much short covering in TCS yet. With the bounce-back in the index, the stock is likely to witness short covering until it manages to hold on to Rs 3,390.    It is trading above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels, which increases the probability of further upside. Traders may buy TCS Futures in the Rs 3,510 to Rs 3,500 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,650, Rs 3,700    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,390    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    SJS Enterprises | CMP: Rs 1,252.8        SJS is demonstrating a robust price structure on the monthly chart, marked by a series of higher bottoms, indicating long-term strength. On the weekly scale, the stock witnessed buying interest near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upmove from Rs 537 to Rs 1,347. Notably, the March 2025 retracement support aligned with the 100-week EMA, highlighting a bullish mean reversion setup.    Following this support, the stock has resumed its upward trajectory, respecting the prevailing uptrend with consistent follow-through. It is currently trading well above the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, underscoring a strong bullish alignment and reinforcing that market control remains with the bulls.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,457    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,180    Caplin Point Laboratories | CMP: Rs 2,095.7        Caplin Point is exhibiting a strong long-term uptrend on the monthly chart, marked by higher tops and bottoms. In May 2025, it confirmed a breakout above a two-month long wick candlestick pattern, signaling follow-through strength. The stock has remained above its 12-month EMA since May 2023, reinforcing the bullish trend.    On the weekly chart, it is forming a base pattern, while the MACD is in buy mode with a rising histogram, indicating building bullish momentum and a constructive outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,443    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,960    Oberoi Realty | CMP: Rs 1,928.9        Oberoi Realty has broken out of a four-month consolidation and is sustaining above its 26-month EMA, signaling trend continuation. It has rebounded from the 50% Fibonacci level with bullish mean reversion from the 100-week EMA. Supported by the 20- and 50-day EMAs, the MACD in buy mode confirms strong momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,238    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,814    Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) | CMP: Rs 1,037.85        FACT has been exhibiting robust momentum across timeframes, consistently forming higher tops and higher bottoms. On the weekly chart, it has formed a double bottom pattern, followed by a sustained upward move. On the daily scale, the stock has recently retested a falling trendline drawn from June 2024, further reinforcing its bullish outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,245    Stop-Loss: Rs 964    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "Banking stocks remained under pressure for the third consecutive day on Friday, with the Nifty Bank index declining as much as 1.8 percent, weighed down by Axis Bank\u2019s subdued March quarter earnings.    The index, which had touched a record high of 56,098.70 on April 23 during intraday trade, continued to reel under selling pressure and settled lower around the 55,200 mark by Thursday.    In the last three sessions, the Nifty Bank has lost 2.6 percent, largely attributed to profit booking following a sharp rally over the past weeks.    &quot;After the strong upmove in the past two weeks, the index has entered a consolidation phase, with support seen near the 54,500 level \u2014 which aligns with the previous major peak. Sustaining above this zone will be crucial for any fresh upside towards 56,200 and 57,500 in the coming sessions,&quot; said Vaishali Parekh, Vice President - Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher.    Of the 12 constituents of the index, 11 were trading in the red. IndusInd Bank was the sole gainer, up marginally at Rs 821.80 on the NSE.    Axis Bank led the losers, plunging 5.06 percent to an intraday low of Rs 1,146. The country\u2019s third-largest private lender on Thursday reported a marginal fall in net profit for the March quarter at Rs 7,117 crore, compared to Rs 7,130 crore in the same period last year.    The drop in profit was driven by a steep 64 percent jump in provisions for potential loan losses and lower trading income.    Among other key laggards, Punjab National Bank and Federal Bank dropped between 2 and 3 percent, while heavyweights HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank declined around 1 percent each. State Bank of India, the country\u2019s largest public sector lender, was down nearly 2 percent.    The recent rally in banking stocks, seen last week, was sparked after the Reserve Bank of India released updated norms for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on April 21. The central bank had introduced an additional run-off rate of 2.5 percent on internet and mobile banking-enabled retail and small business deposits, prompting market optimism at the time.

        "Description": " Brokerages maintained their bullish view on Reliance Industries, citing growth in Jio, Retail, and recovery in the oil-to-chemicals segment as key drivers.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) slipped in trade on Monday after the diversified conglomerate reported its earnings report for the quarter ended June 30, sparking bullish brokerage commentary.    Reliance Industries reported a 77 percent gain in net profit for the June quarter to Rs 30,783 crore, driven by a one-time gain from divesting its stake in Asian Paints. Even after excluding the Rs 8,924 crore gain, profit was up 25 percent year-on-year, as against Rs 15,138 crore in the same quarter last year.    Further, consolidated revenue rose 6 percent to Rs 2.73 lakh crore, while EBITDA climbed 36 percent to Rs 58,024 crore.    Segment-wise performance    Jio Platforms posted a 25 percent rise in profit to Rs 7,110 crore, with EBITDA up nearly 24 percent to Rs 18,135 crore. Net subscriber additions remained strong at 9.9 million during the quarter, taking the total to 498.1 million.    Reliance Retail\u2019s revenue rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier to Rs 84,171 crore, with EBITDA rising 12.7 percent to Rs 6,381 crore. Consumer brands under the FMCG business reported sales of Rs 11,450 crore in just their second year.    The oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business saw revenue dip 1.5 percent to Rs 1.55 lakh crore from a year earlier due to lower crude prices and planned maintenance shutdowns. However, EBITDA rose 11 percent to Rs 14,511 crore due to favourable margins on domestic fuel retail, and improvements in transportation fuel cracks.    On the new energy business of RIL, which is focused on building a comprehensive and integrated renewable energy ecosystem, Karan Suri, Senior Vice President, New Energy, noted that the new energy business will become a self-funded platform in a few years through its profitability and monetisation.    Should you buy, sell, or hold?    Motilal Oswal has maintained a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,700, expecting strong growth across key segments. Reliance Jio is seen as the main driver, with the brokerage expecting a 19 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY25-28, supported by a likely tariff hike, market share gains, and continued expansion.    According to the brokerage, Reliance Retail\u2019s growth is also expected to recover, with 14-15 percent CAGR in revenue and EBITDA. A rebound in the oil-to-chemicals segment, aided by better refining margins, is likely to lift overall earnings, with RIL\u2019s consolidated EBITDA and PAT projected to grow at an 11 percent annual average over FY25\u201327.    Morgan Stanley maintained its \u2018overweight\u2019 rating with a target price of Rs 1,617. The broking house noted the optimistic guidance from the company, including a plan to double earnings by 2029, despite some near-term misses in retail revenue growth and fuel refining performance. Going ahead, Morgan Stanley believes that the new energy and telecom segments, along with a strong balance sheet, are key positives for RIL.    Jefferies has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating on Reliance Industries with a target price of Rs 1,726. While the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment was impacted by a refinery shutdown, the brokerage sees a constructive outlook for refining going forward.    According to Jefferies, investor focus will shift to the upcoming AGM, with hopes of a Jio listing following a likely tariff hike. The brokerage projected an EBIDTA growth for the full financial year 2026 at 11 percent.    Japan-based Nomura also kept its bullish view intact, with a \u2018buy\u2019 call on Reliance Industries and a target price of Rs 1,600 per share.

        "Date": "2025-07-01",
        "Description": "According to the brokerage, the paint industry is expected to see a recovery in revenue growth in FY26, following a decline in FY25.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "After four long years, domestic brokerage ICICI Securities reversed its negative stance on paints majors Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints Ltd, citing a likely turnaround in the industry.    The broking house upgraded its rating on the paint players to 'add' from 'reduce' earlier, believing that the paint industry revenue growth is likely to recover in FY26 after declining in FY25.    The brokerage hiked its target price on Asian Paints to Rs 2,700 per share, from Rs 2,000 earlier. The target on Berger Paints was raised to Rs 650, up from Rs 515.    In a note, the brokerage clarified why it gave the paints players an 'add' rating, instead of a 'buy' call. In the newer industry landscape - Birla Opus is likely to reach ~10 percent market share in three years, JSW Paints + Akzo Nobel India combined- may result in a fight for third position along with Kansai Nerolac.    ICICI Securities said, &quot;Importantly, we do have some concerns about exit multiples for incumbents as Birla Opus, Indigo Paints, JSW Paints have proven in the last decade that consensus probably overestimated the strength of entry barriers in Paints industry.&quot;    The paint industry is expected to see a recovery in revenue growth in FY26, following a decline in FY25. The slowdown was driven by weaker demand for premium paints and reduced offtake in metros and tier-1 and tier-2 cities.    Additionally, the absence of price-led growth and the use of higher trade offers and schemes to counter rising competitive pressures impacted performance. The industry also saw some market share loss to new entrants. &quot;As most of the issues are behind now, we model there will be recovery in paints growth from H2FY26 onwards,&quot; said ICICI Securities.    The brokerage added that after Birla Opus commenced the paints business in Q4FY24, it has reported steady growth  in revenues with every quarter. &quot;We believe it started reporting sizeable revenues by Q3FY25 (which hurt incumbents). We believe there will be anniversary effect of launch of Birla Opus on paint industry growth by end of Q2FY26.&quot;    On the valuation front, with steep competitive pressures as well as decline in revenues and margin  contraction, the valuation multiples of Asian Paints as well as Berger Paints are below the mean P/E. While the competitive landscape has materially changed, the brokerage believes valuation contraction is largely over (for now).    At 11.45 a.m., shares of Asian Paints were quoting Rs 2,364.9, up over one percent, while Berger Paints stock gave up their intraday gains to trade at Rs 589.4, lower by 0.6 percent.

Transportation vertical downturn was sharp, though already built into ISec\u2019s estimate. Other highlights of Q4 include: 1) 3 large deals signed with higher annuity component, 2) a pivot towards emerging geographies 3) company highlighting growth bounce back in Q1FY26. Though new deals give some near-term respite, structural and macroeconomic issues loom large.  Outlook  We largely maintain our estimates and tweak FY26E EPS by 130bps on slightly better near-term visibility lent by large deals and optimism in healthcare-led demand.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices made a healthy start to the week, with the Nifty 50 rising 1.15 percent on April 22, supported by buying across sectors barring FMCG. Market breadth remained in favour of the bulls, with 2,079 shares advancing compared to 536 declining on the NSE. After a consistent five-day rally, the market may consolidate, though the overall trend remains positive. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 817.50        After peaking near Rs 1,222 in August 2024, LIC witnessed a sharp decline of nearly Rs 500, translating to a 42 percent correction. Recently, the stock has formed a classic Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern \u2014 a bullish reversal setup. The price has also successfully retested the neckline of the pattern and shown strength, indicating a potential trend reversal. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 800\u2013820 zone, with an upside target of Rs 900.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 900    Stop-Loss: Rs 765    Clean Science and Technology | CMP: Rs 1,200.4        Clean Science has recently formed a textbook bullish Bat pattern on the daily chart, supported by rising volumes from the bottom, indicating strong buying interest. Interestingly, the Bat pattern\u2019s reversal zone aligns with the S3 monthly Camarilla pivot, adding technical confluence. Moreover, an Inside Value relationship is observed between March and April pivots, where April\u2019s R3 and S3 lie within March\u2019s range. This setup often precedes a significant breakout, hinting at a potentially explosive move ahead. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,185\u20131,200 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,320    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,140    Cello World | CMP: Rs 584.3        Cello World recently formed a double bottom with bullish divergence and broke above a falling trendline, signaling a potential reversal. Strong volume in the Rs 535\u2013565 zone adds bullish confirmation. Both March and April 2025 Camarilla monthly pivots show an Inside Value relationship, where the current month\u2019s pivot lies within the previous month\u2019s range \u2014 often a precursor to an explosive move. Traders may consider long positions between Rs 580\u2013585.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 680    Stop-Loss: Rs 540    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Central Depository Services May Futures | CMP: Rs 1,311.6        CDSL has provided a breakout from a base formation, primarily due to short covering. The stock had witnessed its highest short build-up in recent times and is now seeing covering, along with its peers, as the entire Nifty Capital Market index has started to recover. In anticipation of further short covering, one can go long on CDSL in the range of Rs 1,280\u20131,260 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,340, Rs 1,360    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220    State Bank of India May Futures | CMP: Rs 816.1        SBI has broken out of a base formation with clear short covering in the recent bounce back, leading the stock to break above the crucial resistance of Rs 800, which had a significant Call base. The stock has now seen clear upward momentum and Put additions at lower levels, which may support any dips. In the short term, all PSU banks are likely to witness an uptrend, and SBIN offers a good setup. Buy SBI May Futures in the range of Rs 820\u2013800.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 850, Rs 870    Stop-Loss: Rs 780    Sun Pharmaceutical Industries May Futures | CMP: Rs 1,746.2        Sun Pharmaceutical has seen long liquidation throughout its uptrend, and the cumulative open interest has now dropped to its lowest level in six years or more, indicating that derivatives positions are quite light. Prices are now providing positive divergence, increasing the chances of an uptrend. Sun Pharma has been one of the relative outperformers in the Nifty Pharma Index and is likely to inch towards the upper end of the range. Buy Sun Pharmaceutical May Futures in the range of Rs 1,760\u20131,740.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,830, Rs 1,860    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,710    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    Hindalco Industries | CMP: Rs 622        Hindalco has broken out of a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, with a close above Rs 618 confirming the breakout. Although volumes were muted, large caps often see follow-up buying. Sustaining above Rs 618 is key for the bulls. The immediate upside target lies near the gap resistance zone of Rs 645\u2013647. A strong close above this level can extend momentum. Until then, it remains a buy-on-dips candidate with defined levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 645    Stop-Loss : Rs 610    SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 909.65        SBI Card has broken out of a 420-day-long bullish Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, with a breakout at Rs 890. While volumes were muted, price action remains strong, and follow-through buying may boost participation. The stock closed above the breakout point and continues to trade comfortably above resistance. A sustained move above Rs 890 could lead to an initial upside target of Rs 1,000. Traders can look to ride the breakout with a tight stop-loss below Rs 890.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 890    Adani Green Energy | CMP: Rs 956.25        Adani Green Energy is nearing a bullish breakout from a 47-day-long down-slanting Cup and Handle pattern, with the neckline placed at Rs 960. The volume pattern is constructive, indicating strong accumulation. A breakout and sustained move above Rs 960 could trigger a sharp rally, initially targeting the swing high of Rs 1,025. If momentum continues, the breakout structure suggests a further upside towards Rs 1,127. Traders should watch for confirmation above Rs 960 to ride the breakout with strength.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,025    Stop-Loss: 930    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "Motilal Oswal's research report on SBI Life Insurance  SBI Life Insurance (SBILIFE) reported 2% YoY growth in new business APE to INR54.5b (in line). For FY25, it grew 8% YoY to INR214.2b. Absolute VNB grew 10% YoY to INR16.6b (14% beat). VNB margin for the quarter stood at 30.5% vs. our estimate of 27.4% (28.3% in 4QFY24). For FY25, VNB grew 7% YoY to INR59.5b, reflecting VNB margin of 27.8%. The strong growth in VNB was attributed to a significant shift in the product mix to non-ULIP products. Shareholder PAT remained flat YoY at INR8.1b (6% miss) in 4QFY25. For FY25, it grew 27% YoY to INR24b. Management expects 13-14% individual APE growth in FY26, which will be slightly above industry growth of 12% on the back of continued expansion and productivity improvement of agency channel (expecting 25% growth for FY26) and stable momentum in bancassurance channel (expecting 8-10% growth for FY26). VNB margin is expected to maintain the 27-28% range in FY26.  Outlook  We expect SBILIFE to clock a CAGR of 15%/17% in APE/VNB over FY25-27, while RoEV is likely to remain at ~19% over FY27. We have slightly cut our APE estimates considering company guidance and have increased our VNB margin estimates due to an expected shift toward traditional products and improvement in product-level margins. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR2,000 (premised on 2.0x FY27E EV).

        "Content": "Motilal Oswal's research report on SBI Life Insurance  SBI Life Insurance (SBILIFE) reported 9% YoY growth in new business APE to INR39.7b (in line). VNB margin for the quarter stood at 27.4% vs our estimate of 28.5% (26.8% in 1QFY25). Absolute VNB grew 12% YoY to INR10.9b (in-line), driven by the product mix shift toward non-linked products. Shareholder PAT grew 14% YoY to INR5.9b (in-line) in 1QFY26. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of mid-teen APE growth, supported by new non-par and protection product launches. Apart from the focus on product mix shift toward non-linked products, higher sales of products with larger sum assured and improved rider attachment are expected to drive VNB margin expansion to 26-28% for FY26, according to management. We expect SBILIFE to clock a CAGR of 16%/19% in APE/VNB over FY25-27, while RoEV is likely to remain at ~19% over FY27. We maintain our estimates and reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR2,140 (premised on 2.2x FY27E EV).

        "Content": "Leading pharma exporters to US could potentially face business disruption, reflecting in the share prices on May 6, after President Trump signed an Executive Order to promote domestic drug manufacturing facilities.    Shares of Sun Pharma were lower by over 1.5 percent as the top Sensex loser, while Cipla is down over 2 percent, Biocon down 0.3 percent, and Lupin's share were lower by more than 3 percent as the top laggard on BSE 100 in early trade. The Nifty Pharma index was lower by 1.5 percent in early trade, with Aurobindo Pharma as the top loser, down over 3 percent, and followed by Lupin and Cipla.    US President Trump signed the executive order on May 5 to rebuild US prescription drug manufacturing, with a eye on reducing reliance on foreign-made medicines, and has directed authorities to accelerate facilities designed to make prescription drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and other necessary raw materials. The order is seen as a step towards reducing US' dependence on foreign medicines, and step up domestic production of key pharma ingredients.    Leading US Pharma Exporters    For Sun Pharma, US revenue for March quarter came in at $474 million, and accounted for more than 30% of the company's consolidated sales. The company has been taking steps to offset the slide in the generics business sales by growing its specialty business growth, and even exploring potential acquisitions in this space. Sun Pharma clocked as much as 72.7% of its total turnover via exports in FY24.    Other major US pharma exporters from India include Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy\u2019s Labs, Lupin, Cipla.    What The Executive Order Entails    The USFDA is expected to submit a report within 180 days of the order, reviewing regulations and guidance on development of domestic pharma manufacturing. The Executive Order also proposes steps to eliminate ' duplicative or unnecessary requirements' in regulations.    Within 90 days of the date of the order, the USFDA is required to develop improvements to its inspection regime to ensure 'routine reviews' of overseas manufacturing facilities that supply medicines to the US. The order proposes an increased fee on foreign manufacturing facilities.    The order has also proposed a centralized coordination of environmental permits required to expand domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing capacities.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also required to ensure faster approvals for factories of pharma products, APIs, and other raw materials. &quot;Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall take action to update regulations and guidance that apply to the inspection and approval of new and expanded manufacturing capacity of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, key starting materials...,&quot; the Executive Order said.",

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on UltraTech Cement  Industry leader UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) has made a convincing start to FY26 with Q1FY26 EBITDA surging 46% YoY (in line with our estimate) riding benefits of a) improved price environment, b) M&amp;amp;A benefits driving industry superior volume growth and c) sustained efficiency enhancement measures. The earnings momentum may pace up further tracking UTCEM\u2019s commentary (echoed by our channel checks) of firm prices sustaining in the seasonally weak Q2. In our view, firm prices (at current levels) in Q2 have the potential to shore up FY26 consensus EBITDA (our estimates being ~11% higher vs. consensus). Further, it is heartening to see UTCEM walkingthe-talk with its efficiency enhancement measures across \u2013 reducing lead distance, rising CC ratio, increase in share of premium cement sales and higher share of green power. Factoring in these benefits, we revise up our FY27E EBITDA by ~4% (keeping FY26E broadly unchanged).    Outlook  We continue to value UTCEM at 19x FY27E EV/EBITDA and maintain BUY with a revised TP of INR 14,600.

        "Author": "Broker Research",
        "Content": "ICICI Securities's research report on SBI Life Insurance Company  SBI Life has provided a mid-teen growth guidance in volume and maintains a healthy 26\u201328% VNB margin guidance for FY26. We believe this is a sound growth target, especially when compared to mixed trends of credit, motor and health premium growth among other parameters and when juxtaposed with ~14% overall private APE CAGR between FY19\u201325. VNB margin guidance remains at 26\u201328% while the company continues to have a very strong record of positive operating variance/assumption changes. Product mix improvement (launch of non-par product), better productivity (branch and agent) and demand recovery in high-margin segments provide scope for positive margin surprise and could offset the impact of lower volumes on VNB. These arguments vs. its sound track record (APE/VNB/EV CAGR of 15.3%/21.8%/20.5% between FY20-25) and attractive valuation (1.9x FY27E P/EV) keep us constructive on SBI Life.  Outlook  We factor in VNB margin of 27.5% and model 15% APE growth in FY26E/27E (8.6%/9.2% YoY APE growth and 27.8%/27.5% VNB margin in FY25/Q1FY26).

        "Date": "2025-07-18",
        "Description": "Reliance Industries Q1FY26: Mukesh Ambani believes that the performance of businesses and growth initiatives gives confidence that Reliance will continue its stellar track record of doubling every 4-5 years.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries has started off the fiscal year 2026 with a robust, all-round operational and financial performance in the April-June period. It has reported highest-ever consolidated quarterly EBITDA and net profit during the quarter, backed by telecom, retail and oil-to-chemical businesses.    &quot;Consolidated EBITDA for Q1FY26 improved strongly from a year-ago period, despite significant volatility in global macros,&quot; Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.    He strongly believes that the performance of businesses and growth initiatives gives confidence that Reliance will continue its stellar track record of doubling every 4-5 years.    In the said quarter, Reliance shares recorded healthy performance, rising 17.7 percent and strongly outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50.    Here are 10 key highlights from the June Quarter Earnings:    1) Bottomline    The profit increased sharply by 76.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 30,783 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, with strong operating numbers. In the year-ago period, the profit was Rs 17,445 crore.    Excluding proceeds from sale of listed investments, the profit grew by 25 percent YoY, Reliance said.    Other income for the quarter at Rs 15,119 crore included Rs 8,924 crore proceeds from sale of listed investments, increasing nearly four times from Rs 3,983 crore seen in the corresponding period of previous fiscal.    Finance costs increased by 18.9 percent YoY to Rs 7,036 crore, largely due to operationalisation of 5G spectrum assets, the company said, adding the tax expenses jumped to Rs 6,465 crore for the quarter, up 11.7 percent YoY.    2) Topline    The telecom-retail-to-oil major has recorded revenue at Rs 2.73 lakh crore for the June quarter, rising 6 percent from Rs 2.57 lakh crore in the same period last fiscal, with double-digit growth in Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail.    3) Operating Performance    The company has seen a massive 35.7 percent YoY increase in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation) to Rs 58,024 crore for the June quarter, thanks to the healthy double-digit growth in telecom, retail, and oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segments.    The EBITDA margin has expanded significantly by 460 bps to 21.2 percent in Q1FY26, up from 16.6 percent in Q1FY25, as Jio Platforms (JPL), and O2C saw triple-digit expansion in margin.    4) Jio Platforms    JPL has reported revenue at Rs 41,054 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, increasing 18.8 percent YoY due to strong subscriber growth across mobility and homes, increased consumption and sustained positive momentum in digital services.    The segment's profit for the quarter soared by 24.9 percent on-year to Rs 7,110 crore. EBITDA zoomed 23.9 percent to Rs 18,135 crore driven by strong growth in ARPU (average revenue per user) and 210 bps margin expansion led by operational efficiencies. The margin was at 51.8 percent for the quarter.    Mukesh Ambani said Jio has scaled newer heights during the quarter including crossing 20 crore 5G subscribers and 2 crore home connects. &quot;Jio AirFiber is now the largest FWA service provider in the world, with a base of 74 lakh subscribers,&quot; he added.    Jio Platforms maintained its market leadership with 49.8 crore subscribers, with net addition of 99 lakh subscribers in Q1FY26. ARPU at Rs 208.8 per subscriber per month during the quarter, up by 14.9 percent over Rs 181.7 seen in Q1FY25.    The growth in data traffic was 24 percent YoY at 54.7 billion GB.    5) Reliance Retail    Retail\u2019s business performance registered customer base expanded to 35.8 crore, along with significant improvement across operating metrics, Ambani said. The segment has opened 388 new stores during the quarter, taking the total store count to 19,592.    Reliance Retail Ventures has reported 33.2 percent year-on-year growth in profit to Rs 3,267 crore, and 11.3 percent increase in revenue to Rs 84,171 crore.    &quot;All segments performed well, with market leading performance in grocery and fashion. Consumer electronics and devices impacted because of early onset of monsoons, recovery underway,&quot; Reliance said.    The EBITDA grew by 12.7 percent YoY to Rs 6,381 crore, with industry leading EBITDA margin which improved further by 20 bps to 8.7 percent in June quarter.    6) Oil-To-Chemicals    During the quarter, Ambani said energy markets encountered heightened uncertainty, with sharp fluctuations in crude prices. But &quot;the O2C business delivered strong growth, with thrust on domestic demand fulfillment and offering value-added solutions through Jio-bp network. Performance was supported by improvement in fuel and downstream product margins,&quot; he added.    O2C segment EBITDA for Q1FY26 increased by 10.8 percent YoY to Rs 14,511 crore due to favourable margins on domestic fuel retail, improvements in transportation fuel cracks as well as PP (polypropylene) &amp;amp; PVC ((polyvinyl chloride)) deltas. This was partially offset by lower volumes due to planned turnaround, and decline in polyester chain margins. The margin expanded 110 bps to 9.4 percent in the same period.    Revenue for the segment was lower by 1.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1.55 lakh crore due to fall in crude oil prices and lower volumes on account of planned shutdown. However, revenues were supported by higher domestic placement of transportation fuels through Jio-bp network.    Reliance BP Mobility (operating under brand Jio-bp) operated a strong country-wide network of 1,991 fuel retail outlets at the end of June quarter, increasing from 1,730 in Q1FY25.    7) Oil &amp;amp; Gas    Oil &amp;amp; gas (exploration and production) segment has registered revenue at Rs 6,103 crore in the quarter ended June 2025, which was lower by 1.2 percent YoY mainly due to lower sales volume of KGD6 gas in line with natural decline in production. Revenue was also impacted by lower gas price for CBM gas and lower crude price realisation. This was partly offset by higher KGD6 gas price.    Reliance said the average price realised for KGD6 gas was $9.97 per MMBTU (metric million British thermal units) in Q1FY26, against $9.27/MMBTU in Q1FY25. The average price realised for CBM gas was lower at $9.90 per MMBTU against $11.59 per MMBTU during the same period.    The segment EBITDA declined 4.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,996 crore on lower revenues coupled with higher operating costs due to maintenance activity. The margin was down by 240 bps to 81.9 percent YoY.    KGD6 production in June quarter stood at 63.9 BCFe (billion cubic feet equivalent), declined by 7.9 percent YoY, however, CBM production increased by 21.7 percent to 2.8 BCFe.    8) JioStar    JioStar reported record revenues of Rs 11,222 crore with EBITDA of Rs 1,017 crore and profit of Rs 581 crore for the first quarter of current fiscal 2026. The performance was driven by a successful IPL season with strong growth across both TV and digital platforms.    Reliance said the quarter saw remarkable growth, achieving a subscriber base of 28.7 crore during IPL on JioHotstar and reaching over 80 crore people on TV during the quarter. &quot;With key launches, sustained leadership across markets, and a strategic entry into the FTA Hindi GEC space, the network further consolidated its position with a 35.5% Entertainment TV share.&quot;    9) Capex    Capital expenditure (excluding amount incurred towards spectrum) for the quarter ended June 2025 was Rs 29,875 crore, against Rs 28,785 crore in the year-ago period.    10) Cash, and Debt    Cash &amp;amp; cash equivalents at the end of June 2025 stood at Rs 2.2 lakh crore, against Rs 1.92 lakh crore in the three months period ended June 2024.    The outstanding debt was Rs 3.38 lakh crore at the end of June quarter, against Rs 3.05 lakh crore in Q1FY25, while the net debt was Rs 1.17 lakh crore against Rs 1.12 lakh crore in the same period.

        "Content": "Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, said on Thursday it is expanding its quick commerce network and fashion verticals as it seeks to consolidate its position across key consumption categories, ahead of its much-awaited initial public offering.    \u201cReliance Retail delivered resilient performance during this quarter, driven by our relentless focus on operational excellence, geographical expansion and sharper product portfolio. Our continued investments in cutting-edge technologies and differentiated product offerings have enabled us to serve our customers better and scale with agility,\u201d said Isha Ambani, Executive Dir`ector, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd.    The retailer added 388 stores during the quarter, taking its total store count to over 19,592 in the June quarter. Gross revenue rose 11.3% from a year earlier, supported by steady performance across grocery, fashion, and consumer electronics, the company\u2019s chief financial officer Dinesh Taluja said in a post-earnings call on July 18.    Quick-com boost    Reliance\u2019s quick commerce platform, JioMart, saw daily orders grow 68  percent sequentially and 175 percent on a year-on-year basis. The company said it now delivers to over 1,000 cities and 4,300 pin codes, making it the fastest-growing digital grocery platform in India. About 21 percent of orders now include fruits and vegetables, compared to 9 percent six months ago.    \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stickiness which is coming in, a lot of repeat behaviour which is coming in, which is driving traffic onto the platform, he said, adding that the company will focus on habit-forming categories like fruits and vegetables, which would see repeat orders.    The company has also launched JioRush, a hyperlocal delivery service promising four-hour delivery, which is live in six cities and has shown bill values 50\u201360% higher than regular transactions, Taluja said.    Jewellery, fashion and consumer brands     In jewellery, he noted changing trends due to rising gold prices. \u201cThe business is on steady growth, but obviously there is an impact on the significant increase in gold prices. In volume terms, the demand for gold has gone down,\u201d he said.    \u201cTo make it more affordable, especially for everyday wear, we are offering 18-carat jewellery as an alternative to 20\u201322 carat jewellery.\u201d    The fashion business, which had a \u201ctough year\u201d previously, showed signs of recovery. RRVL is on a spree to modernise its stores to make them more appealing for the younger audiences, improving footfall.    \u201cWe have also taken several initiatives over the last few quarters\u2026 We\u2019ve also shrunk the design to shelf cycle to 30 days. So there\u2019s a lot more freshness in our stores and we\u2019re using a lot of AI to come up with designs which are in trend,\u201d Taluja said.    \u201cOur approach of winning in every price format is working across price points and across formats,\u201d he added.  The company is looking to focus on building a lot of non-apparel categories like beauty and personal care to improve the bill value from the customer who is buying apparel.    The consumer brands business also reported strong performance. \u201cOur revenues were up 2x on a YOY basis. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on the vision which our chairman laid down in the last AGM of doubling our business every three to four years.\u201d    Taluja confirmed that the FMCG vertical will be carved out. \u201cThis business is being de-merged\u2026 into a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. Once the regulatory approvals are in place, it will become an independent business.\u201d    Q1 performance    Net profit rose to Rs 3,271 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 2,549 crore in the same period last year, the company said on July 18.    The company\u2019s consolidated gross revenue came in at Rs 84,171 crore, a 11 percent rise from Rs 75,615  crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, revenue declined 5 per cent from Rs 88,620 crore in the March quarter.    Retail revenue was projected to rise 20.8 percent year-on-year and 3.1 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 91,380 crore, with an EBITDA margin of 7.6 percent, according to Moneycontrol survey of nine analysts.    Its EBITDA margin rose 20 basis points to 8.7 per cent from 8.5 per cent in the same quarter last year.    Reliance Retail has a presence across diverse categories including electronics, groceries, apparel, footwear, jewellery, eyewear, pharmaceuticals, and handicrafts. It operates stores under well-known brands like Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital, Trends, and MyJio.    \u201cBusiness continued to focus on expanding non-apparel categories like footwear, beauty and personal care and accessories to offer wider choices to customers,\u201d RRVL said in a statement.    Reliance Retail\u2019s registered customer base grew 13.3  percent from a year earlier to 358 million, while total transactions rose 16.5  percent to 389 million.",

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "CP Gurnani, IT industry veteran and former CEO of Tech Mahindra, said layoffs at TCS imply that the period of judging Indian IT firms based on their headcount will soon be over, and instead, an output and outcome-based business model should likely be under focus.    While speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gurnani said, &quot;The focus on the Sholay dialogue 'Kitne aadmi the' or judging the Indian IT industry based on headcount - that period will be over.&quot;    &quot;We will have to rewire ourselves to focus on output and outcome-based business models, outcome-based pricing, and more importantly what it does for business and customers, instead of looking at IT and systems in isolation,&quot; he said.    Speaking on the job cut, Gurnani said that while some roles may be cut, may more will likely be created as a result of artificial intelligence (AI). &quot;If you see the job openings at these companies, they have only increased since the previous year. This is because they need more AI engineers, more data scientists, prompt engineers and people who can collapse few functions of an organisation,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no point of having an HR organization. Ultimately, it will become how do I serve my employee. That means it is a data centric organization, with a human touch,&quot; he added.    Gurnani said that the move reflects the humanization of AI, which means that while some routine jobs may be cut, new jobs may be created.    Ganesh Natarajan, Executive Chairman of GTT Data Solutions, said that over a million jobs will get redundant in the coming days as result of AI. These would include roles related to testing, documentation, programming and more. However, he also feels that several more roles will be created simultaneously.    &quot;We have to be prepared for a few years of churn. We have been telling people to move from transitional AI to game changing AI. So, this 'game changing AI' means game changing for the organization. So, we have to be prepared for the future focused model, and the [churn] is not going to stop here. It will take place over the next two-three years. I think we should tighten our seatbelts and be prepared for lots of changes,&quot; he said.

We are keeping a close eye on all of this,&quot; a source told this website.    The IT giant's move comes amid rapid disruptions in technology. However, the firm's CEO K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that the move was not a fallout of the adoption of artificial intelligence, but to address skills for the future.    &amp;nbsp;",

Growth improvement reflects positive outcomes of HUVR\u2019s recent growth aspiration initiatives. Home Care delivered high-single-digit volume growth, while revenue was up only 2% YoY. There was an adverse pricing impact as HUVR maintained a competitive price-value equation and passed on lower commodity costs to consumers. EBIT margin was down 50bp but up 70bp QoQ YoY at 19.5%.  Outlook  We believe the new CEO can further capitalize on the volume drive with her understanding of Indian consumers and the company\u2019s execution playbook.

        "Description": "Backed by strong technical indicators and firm sectoral participation, Nifty now looks poised to extend its northward journey in the coming weeks and is likely to test the level of 25,800, followed by 26,100 in the short term, said SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities believes Bank Nifty is well on track to test the 60,000 milestone before Diwali. The recent breakout from a Stage-2 cup pattern on the daily chart\u2014a classic continuation formation that typically signals the start of a strong upward leg,&quot; he said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    Further, technically, Bank Nifty remains well-supported above all its key short and long-term moving averages, and momentum indicators on both daily and weekly charts\u2014such as RSI and MACD\u2014are firmly in bullish mode, he reasoned.    Meanwhile, he holds a bullish view on Affle, Abbott India, InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo), and MCX India. &quot;All four stocks are currently trading at or near their respective all-time highs \u2014 a clear sign of strength and underlying demand,&quot; the Deputy Vice President, Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities said.    Do you expect the Nifty to hit a new record high in the July series, considering the strong momentum?    The Nifty 50 broke free from its rangebound structure, delivering a sharp upside move last week and ending above the 25,600 mark, with a 2.09% gain. More importantly, this move led to the highest weekly close since September 2024, confirming that the breakout wasn\u2019t just symbolic\u2014it was structural. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a sizeable bullish candle, a visual expression of strong momentum and renewed buying conviction.    This breakout was not an isolated event. It comes with improving breadth across sectors such as financial services, private banks, oil &amp;amp; gas, infrastructure, and auto, many of which have also seen breakout patterns of their own. Backed by strong technical indicators and firm sectoral participation, Nifty now looks poised to extend its northward journey in the coming weeks and is likely to test the level of 25,800, followed by 26,100 in the short term. On the downside, the zone of 25,400-25,350 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    Historically, how has the month of July performed for equity markets, and do you expect a similar trend in July 2025?    Tracking seasonality, over the past 18 years, the July month has often exhibited a positive trend for Nifty. On 14 occasions, the index has concluded on a positive note with an average gain of 4.60%, while on only 4 occasions, it has ended on a negative note with an average loss of 2.37%. The average return for Nifty in the July series has been 3.05%. Over the past 18 years, July has consistently shown an average volatility of 7.20 percent for the Nifty index.    Historically, Bank Nifty has also shown a positive trend in July over the past 18 years. Out of these, it closed positively 13 times, with an average gain of 4.52%, while ending negatively 5 times, with an average loss of 3.58%. The average return for Bank Nifty in the July series has been 2.27%. However, Bank Nifty has demonstrated an average volatility of approximately 10 percent for the past 18 years.    How do you interpret the rollover data?    Throughout the June series, Nifty futures largely remained confined within a narrow trading band of just 732 points, reflecting a phase of indecisiveness and rangebound activity. Since mid-May, the index has been oscillating in a tight consolidation zone between 25,307 to 24,575 levels, suggesting a lack of clear directional bias among market participants.    On the expiry day, the Nifty futures finally staged a decisive breakout from this prolonged consolidation phase and ended the June series above the 25,500 mark, registering a healthy gain of 2.69%. This breakout not only signals a potential shift in short-term sentiment but also sets a positive tone for the July series. From a derivatives perspective, the rollover of Nifty Futures increased to 79.53% in June, slightly higher than May\u2019s 79.10% and also above the three-month average of 79.24%, indicating continued participation and positioning by traders heading into the new series.    The number of shares rolled surged to 162 lakhs compared to 149 lakh last month. However, the rollover cost dipped to 0.25%, below the three-month average of 0.43%.    Bank Nifty Futures traded in a narrow 1800-point range during the June series, marking the second straight month of muted price action. However, it gained momentum on the expiry day, closing above 57,200 with a 2.48% gain. From a derivatives standpoint, the rollover of Bank Nifty Futures declined to 75.75% in the June series \u2014 a noticeable drop compared to May\u2019s 79.29% and also below the three-month average of 76.70%. This suggests a relatively cautious stance among traders and possibly a lighter carry-forward of positions into the July series.    Adding to this, the rollover cost dipped to 0.07%, significantly lower than the three-month average of 0.32%, reflecting a cautious rollover with limited aggressive long buildup.    What are your top two picks for the month of July?    Apollo Hospitals Enterprises    On a daily scale, the stock has given an Ascending Triangle pattern breakout along with robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above all the moving averages, and these averages are in rising mode. The Daily RSI has also given a 2-month consolidation breakout, which suggests pickup in upside momentum. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 7,320-7,280 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 7,080. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 7,750 in the short term.    Glaxosmithkline Pharmaceuticals    The stock has recently formed a strong base near its 34-day EMA level and thereafter started moving higher. The reversal from the support zone is confirmed by relatively higher volume. The daily RSI is surged above 60 mark and it is in rising mode, which is a bullish sign. Considering the current chart structure, we believe the stock is likely to continue its northward journey in the next couple of trading sessions. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,450-3,430 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 3,330. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 3,600 in the short term.    Do you think the Bank Nifty will find it easy to hit the 60,000 mark before Diwali?    Yes, we believe Bank Nifty is well on track to test the 60,000 milestone before Diwali. The index has already marked fresh all-time highs over the last two trading sessions, clearly outperforming the broader Nifty index, which still trades nearly 2.5 percent below its own record levels. This relative strength underscores the leadership of the banking space in the current market rally.    What further reinforces this bullish outlook is the recent breakout from a Stage-2 cup pattern on the daily chart\u2014a classic continuation formation that typically signals the start of a strong upward leg.    Technically, Bank Nifty remains well-supported above all its key short and long-term moving averages, and momentum indicators on both daily and weekly charts\u2014such as RSI and MACD\u2014are firmly in bullish mode. This alignment of bullish signals across multiple timeframes suggests strong trend strength and buying interest.    Considering these technical factors, we expect Bank Nifty to maintain its upward momentum and approach the 60,000 mark in the coming months.    Are you bullish on Affle, Abbott India, IndiGo, and MCX India?    Yes, we hold a bullish view on Affle, Abbott India, IndiGo, and MCX India. From a technical standpoint, all four stocks are currently trading at or near their respective all-time highs \u2014 a clear sign of strength and underlying demand. Additionally, the price structures across these charts remain robust, with the stocks comfortably positioned above their key short-term and long-term moving averages.    Momentum indicators such as the RSI and MACD are also firmly in positive territory, reinforcing the prevailing bullish sentiment. This confluence of favourable technical signals indicates strong upward momentum and suggests that these stocks are well-positioned to extend their gains in the coming sessions.    Unless there\u2019s a sudden shift in broader market sentiment, we expect these counters to maintain their northbound trajectory in the near term.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The shares of Bajaj Finance, SBI Cards and others non-banking financial services (NBFC) strongly surged on June 6 after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the outcome of MPC's meeting, which included a bumper 50 bps key rate cut and 100 bps reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).    While announcing the outcome of RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, Governor Sanjay Malhotra said that the stress in unsecured loans and credit card portfolios has abated. He however added that stress in MFI still persists.    &quot;The stress witnessed earlier in retail segments like unsecured personal loans and credit card receivables portfolio has abated, while the stress in micro-finance segment is persisting. Banks and NBFCs active in these segments are already recalibrating their business models, strengthening their credit underwriting practices and stepping up their collection efforts to avoid any excessive build-up of risks on this front in future,&quot; said Malhotra in his post-monetary policy speech.    SBI Cards and Payment Services soared 4 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 982 apiece. Bajaj Finance shares meanwhile gained nearly 4 percent to trade at Rs 9,256.50 apiece.    Shriram Finance shares surged 4 percent to trade at Rs 678 apiece. Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra Financial Services also made strong gains, jumping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 271 apiece.    Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company and Aadhar Housing Finance shares gained over 2 percent, while Poonawalla Fincorp and RBL Bank were up over 1.5 percent each. Aditya Birla Capital shares meanwhile gained around 1.3 percent.    Notably, the sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Financial Services index higher nearly 1.3 percent to stand at 26,733.    RBI has flagged concerns about unsecured loans multiple times over the years. In February this year, RBI Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao said, &quot;Of late we have seen some concerns of excessive borrowing in unsecured segment and from derivative euphoria in the capital markets.&quot;    While announcing the outcome of MPC's meeting, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra announced the central bank\u2019s decision to cut the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent. Along with that, the central bank changed its stance to \u2018Neutral\u2019 from the earlier \u2018Accommodative\u2019.    The RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra also announced a 100 basis points CRR cut to be effective in 4 equal tranches of 25 basis points starting from September 6, October 4, November 1 and November 29.",

        "Date": "2025-07-07",
        "Description": "Mutual fund, insurance and payments arms of SBI are seen as prime IPO candidates, and analysts see these as accounting for a fourth of the PSU lender's overall value.",
        "Author": "Khushi Keswani",
        "Content": "Leading PSU lender State Bank of India (SBI) may be sitting on a Rs 3.5 lakh crore goldmine, and it\u2019s not in its core lending book. With the Finance Ministry nudging public sector banks to monetise their non-core assets, the spotlight is back on SBI\u2019s powerful but under-appreciated subsidiary portfolio. Analysts believe this hidden value - spread across mutual funds, insurance and payments - could unlock fresh upside for India's largest lender.    For a bank that clocks over Rs 70,000 crore in annual profit, the growth story is evolving. It\u2019s no longer just about net interest margins or slippages. It\u2019s now about how the market values the sum of SBI\u2019s parts, especially the unlisted ones that have matured into cash-generating businesses. If SBI moves ahead with IPOs, starting with SBI Mutual Fund, it could mark a valuation inflection point, with significant re-rating potential.    \u201cSBI\u2019s subsidiaries contribute nearly Rs 3.5 lakh crore to its SOTP value-based on market cap and AUM benchmarks. Stripping out overvaluation and applying a holding company discount, we estimate a realisable value of around Rs 2.5 lakh crore,\u201d said Vikas Gupta, CEO &amp;amp; Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital.    That would be roughly one-third of SBI\u2019s current market capitalisation of Rs 7.1 lakh crore.    The Value of the Parts    The unlisted arms - SBI Mutual Fund, SBI General Insurance, and SBI Capital Markets - together account for a meaningful chunk of SBI\u2019s embedded value. According to the FY25 annual report, the PBT contribution from subsidiaries and associates stood at Rs 14,217 crore, up 15 percent on-year.    Among these, SBI Mutual Fund is the most mature, with over Rs 11 lakh crore in AUM, making it India\u2019s largest asset manager. SBI owns 63 percent of the AMC, with the remainder held by France\u2019s Amundi. Analysts believe the mutual fund business alone could command a valuation of Rs 60,000\u201375,000 crore upon listing, implying SBI\u2019s stake may be worth Rs 37,000-47,000 crore, not far behind listed peers like HDFC AMC.    Given that HDFC AMC trades at ~8x book and 25x earnings, SBI MF - with its massive SIP book and operating efficiency - could fetch similar or higher multiples.    \u201cThe IPO of SBI Mutual Fund is likely to be the next significant monetisation event, unlocking substantial value,\u201d said a recent note by Motilal Oswal.    SBI General Insurance and SBI Payment Services, though smaller, are also seen as promising.    SBI holds a 70 percent stake in SBI General Insurance, which is already among the top five private players by gross premiums. The last fiscal year saw SBI General posting over Rs 500 crore in net profit. A potential IPO here could fetch a valuation of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore, again adding incremental visibility to the SOTP.    SBI also owns controlling stakes in other profitable but low-profile entities like SBI Capital Markets, SBI DFHI, SBI Payments, and SBI Global Factors. These companies contribute over Rs 1,000 crore in aggregate profits, according to brokerage estimates. The FY25 annual report pegs the total pre-tax profit of subsidiaries and associates at Rs 14,217 crore (up 15 percent year-on-year), with SBI Life accounting for nearly a third of that.    SBI Payments has a dominant UPI/merchant acquiring footprint, though governance issues linked to Hitachi\u2019s 26 percent stake need resolution before an IPO can be explored.    \u201cWe continue to value the core bank at 1.2x FY27E adjusted book value, with subsidiaries contributing Rs 241 per share to our SOTP-based target price of Rs 960,\u201d said JM Financial in a recent note.    Motilal Oswal pegs the value of SBI\u2019s subsidiaries even higher \u2014 at Rs 245 per share \u2014 and sees them as the key re-rating trigger.    \u201cWe maintain SBI as our top \u2018Buy\u2019 idea among PSU banks with a target price of Rs 925, premised on 1.2x FY27E ABV plus Rs 245 for subsidiaries,\u201d the brokerage said.    Nirmal Bang has gone a step further and values the subsidiaries at Rs 252.3 per share in its SOTP, which translates into a target price of Rs 1,013.    While SBI Life and SBI Cards are already listed, their market cap contributions are often undervalued in SBI\u2019s share price due to holding company discounts. SBI Life, for instance, has a market capitalisation of over Rs 1.2 lakh crore, of which SBI\u2019s 56 percent stake is worth nearly Rs 67,000 crore. Yet the bank\u2019s own market cap (~Rs 7.1 lakh crore) reflects only a partial mark-to-market of these assets \u2014 largely due to conglomerate discount.    Downside Protection    The IPO of SBI MF, expected in FY26, could become a turning point. Beyond the cash inflow, it would offer price discovery, enhance transparency, and allow the market to ascribe cleaner valuations to other subsidiaries.    As Sharekhan said, even if core profitability comes under some pressure in FY26 due to narrowing NIMs, SBI remains well-positioned to sustain RoA around one percent and RoE above 14 percent, with ample headroom to monetise investments.    SBI\u2019s CET-1 ratio of 10.8 percent, according to JPMorgan, is an indication that these monetisations would be opportunistic and not driven by capital stress \u2014 which is key to investor confidence.    \u201cWith such strong embedded value, SBI has multiple levers \u2014 to improve capital ratios, support credit growth, or unlock shareholder wealth,\u201d said a private equity investor. Besides, investor appetite is healthy for themes like insurance and digital payments, but size and sustainability matter, said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. \u201cSBI has the balance sheet strength and brand pull \u2014 now it needs to time the listings right,\u201d he added.

        "Date": "2025-02-13",
        "Description": "While the market may rebound amid consolidation, sustaining the expected recovery is key to watch. Below are some trading ideas for the near term.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Bulls seem to be getting no chance to take control over Dalal Street as the benchmark indices extended their downtrend for seven days in a row, with negative market breadth. A total of 1,357 shares saw a correction compared to 1,217 shares that advanced on the NSE. While the market may rebound amid consolidation, sustaining the expected recovery is key to watch. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Bajaj Finserv | CMP: Rs 1,849.25        Bajaj Finserv has shown robust upward momentum. The stock\u2019s recent breakout was supported by significant trading volume, indicating strong investor interest. The chart reveals a steady climb, with the 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) trending upward and converging towards the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. This alignment of moving averages suggests a continuation of the bullish trend if supported by further buying pressure, affirming its inherent strength.    While facing minor resistance at the Rs 1,850 level, a breakout beyond this threshold could pave the way for further upward momentum. Sustaining levels above Rs 1,900 may propel the stock towards the next target at Rs 2,000, presenting a promising outlook for investors.    Reinforcing the positive sentiment, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) comfortably rests at 64.15, indicating a favourable balance between buying and selling pressures. The technical parameters collectively suggest a constructive environment for Bajaj Finserv, encouraging potential bullish movements in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,770    Muthoot Finance | CMP: Rs 2,317.8        Muthoot Finance is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, hitting an all-time high of Rs 2,334.8 on Thursday. This breakout has been accompanied by a consolidation of the upward movement, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.    Additionally, Muthoot Finance is trading above key moving averages, including the short-term (20-day), medium-term (50-day), and long-term (200-day) EMAs, further affirming its bullish stance. The momentum indicator, RSI, is at 63.44. For traders, keeping an eye on the strong support near the Rs 2,222 level is advisable, as a breach of this level could signal a shift in sentiment. Overall, Muthoot Finance's current technical setup suggests a favourable environment for further upside potential.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,222    Redington | CMP: Rs 244.55        After a period of small falls and sideways consolidation, Redington has recently broken the neckline levels of Rs 230 and is rising quickly on the upside with substantial volume. There are expectations of further upward movement, potentially reaching Rs 265. On the downside, substantial support is evident near Rs 235.    Furthermore, Redington is trading above key exponential moving averages (EMAs), including the 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. This suggests strong bullish momentum, indicating the potential for continued upward price action. The RSI stands at 65.17, signaling an upward trajectory and confirming an increase in buying momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 265    Stop-Loss: Rs 235    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 860        SBI Card has broken out from a Pole and Flag pattern with a large-bodied bullish candlestick and a surge in volumes to support the up move. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) Indicator is rising, which confirms the bullish momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 905    Stop-Loss: Rs 835    Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,409        Bajaj Finance has taken support and headed up after retesting its 20-day EMA support levels. Higher-than-average traded volumes were visible to support the up move. The ADX (Average Directional Index) line is rising, which confirms the strength of the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 8,915    Stop-Loss: Rs 8,145    UPL | CMP: Rs 630        UPL has retested its breakout from a consolidation on the daily chart. It is respecting its 20-day EMA, with slight dips being bought into. The RSI indicator is positively placed, which has bullish implications.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 670    Stop-Loss: Rs 610    Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities    Jubilant Foodworks | CMP: Rs 662        Jubilant Foodworks has reached a major support level of Rs 638.65 on its daily charts and formed a bullish Inverted Hammer candlestick pattern. With strong volume and signs of momentum pickup, we anticipate an upside target of Rs 735 and above. The RSI (14) is around 42, showing an upward trend, further strengthening the stock\u2019s outlook. A strict stop-loss of Rs 620 is recommended.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 735    Stop-Loss: Rs 620    Sterling Tools | CMP: Rs 403.1        Sterling Tools has touched its trendline support at Rs 395, forming Doji candlestick patterns, which indicate indecision at current levels. With the risk-reward ratio favouring bulls, it is ideal to take a small position with a strict stop-loss at Rs 380. The stock presents a low-risk setup, and the RSI (14) is recovering from lower levels, signaling strength.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 475    Stop-Loss: Rs 380    Imagicaaworld Entertainment | CMP: Rs 71.81        Imagicaaworld Entertainment has tested its major anchored VWAP (volume weighted average price) support in the Rs 70-71 zone and is showing signs of reversal from lower levels. Technically, a strict stop-loss should be placed at Rs 65 as the stock gains momentum. Following the company's Q3 earnings announcement, the stock surged, and further upside is expected. The Rs 70-71 zone presents a good buying opportunity with a strict stop-loss at Rs 65, targeting Rs 80 and beyond.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 80    Stop-Loss: Rs 65    Kunal Kamble, Senior Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza    Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | CMP: Rs 1,390.8        Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company has formed a base near the Rs 1,184-Rs 1,164 support zone, presenting an accumulation opportunity. The stock recently broke out of resistance at Rs 1,367, and a close above this level indicates that buyers anticipate further upside toward Rs 1,590-Rs 1,650. Higher volumes supported the breakout, reflecting strong participation and buyer interest. Additionally, the price took support at the 50-day EMA and has started moving higher, suggesting continued strength. Moving forward, the 50-day EMA will act as strong support. The RSI remains in the 50-60 range, confirming the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,590, Rs 1,650    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,280    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Title": "Chartist talk: SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah sees rally continuing in these 5 stocks next week",
        "Date": "2025-07-27",
        "Description": "The 100-day EMA zone of 24,600-24,550 will act as immediate support for the Nifty 50. Any sustainable move below the level of 24,550 will lead to further correction upto the 24,200 level. However, on the upside, the 20-day EMA zone of 25,100-25,150 will be the crucial hurdle for the index, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "With no clear positive cues on the domestic or global front, the market appears vulnerable to further consolidation or downside in the near term, said Sudeep Shah, Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities, in an interview with Moneycontrol.    However, he is betting on Shyam Metalics and Energy and Cipla for next week. &quot;Shyam Metalics has confirmed a Cup and Handle pattern breakout, accompanied by robust volume on the weekly chart, while Cipla has registered a breakout above a downward sloping trendline on the daily chart, signaling a potential trend reversal.    Further, he expects the rally in Torrent Pharma, Sharda Cropchem, and Vimta Labs to continue next week. &quot;On the weekly chart, Torrent Pharma has confirmed a Stage-2 Cup pattern breakout, backed by strong volumes, while Sharda Cropchem and Vimta Labs stocks are trading well above their key moving averages, and all major indicators and momentum oscillators are aligned in favour of the bulls,&quot; he reasoned.    Do you expect the Nifty to extend its correction and retest the June lows in the coming week?    The benchmark Nifty index has continued its downward trajectory, extending its losing streak for the fourth consecutive week. This persistent weakness can be attributed to a combination of factors \u2014 the absence of strong positive triggers, Q1 earnings from key corporates coming below expectations, and lingering uncertainty on the global trade deal front, all of which have dampened investor sentiment.    During the week, the index made a feeble attempt to rebound from the crucial support zone; however, the recovery lacked conviction and fizzled out quickly. On Wednesday, Nifty managed to close above its 20-day EMA, briefly reviving hopes of a turnaround. But the optimism was short-lived, as renewed selling pressure dragged the index back into negative territory.    The bearish undertone deepened on Friday, when the index decisively broke below two critical technical levels \u2014 the 50-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of its recent upswing from 24473 to 25669. This breakdown not only reflects fading bullish momentum but also signals growing nervousness among market participants. With no clear positive cues on the domestic or global front, the market appears vulnerable to further consolidation or downside in the near term.    Talking about crucial levels, the 100-day EMA zone of 24,600-24,550 will act as immediate support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 24,550 will lead to further correction up to the 24,200 level. However, on the upside, the 20-day EMA zone of 25,100-25,150 will be the crucial hurdle for the index.    Do you think bears will drag the Bank Nifty below its 50-day EMA next week?    The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has relatively outperformed the broader frontline indices by closing the week on a mildly positive note, even as the overall market sentiment remained weak. Throughout the week, the index attempted to stage a recovery from lower levels, supported by selective buying in heavyweight banking names. However, it once again struggled to surpass the horizontal trendline resistance (57,300-57,400), which continues to act as a formidable barrier for the bulls.    Despite the intraday attempts to break out, the index faced selling pressure near resistance zones and eventually retreated from higher levels. By the end of the week, Bank Nifty settled near the 56,500 mark, registering a modest gain of 0.44 percent.    From a technical standpoint, the weekly price action has resulted in the formation of a Gravestone Doji candlestick pattern, which typically signals indecision in the market and a potential reversal when it appears after an up-move. This pattern, coupled with the repeated failure to breach resistance, suggests caution in the near term, with the need for a strong breakout to resume upward momentum.    Going ahead, the zone of 57,300-57,400 is likely to continue to act as a crucial hurdle for the index while on the downside, the zone of 56,200-56,100 will act as important support for the index as it is the confluence of the 50-day EMA and prior swing low. Any sustainable move below the level of 56,100 will lead to further selling pressure in the index upto the level of 55,500 in the short term.    How are FIIs positioning themselves amid the ongoing bearish sentiment in the market?    Over the past four months, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net buyers in the Indian cash market, investing a total of Rs 24,011 crore \u2014 averaging over Rs 6,000 crore per month. However, this trend has sharply reversed in July, with FIIs pulling out Rs 28,528 crore so far, signaling a significant shift in sentiment. This selling has been far more aggressive than the pockets of mild buying seen on select days.    Alongside, the FII long-short ratio in index futures has dropped steeply from 36.4 on June 30 to just 14.83 by July 24, driven by a sharp rise in short positions \u2014 net contracts worsening from -38,123 to -1.45 lakh.    Multiple factors seem to be at play. The US dollar has strengthened by 0.88 percent since the start of July, making Indian assets relatively less attractive. Additionally, expectations of a Fed rate cut, lack of any major trade deal announcement involving India, and the impact of the Jane Street ban have also weighed on FII sentiment. This combination of heavy outflows, rising shorts, and low confidence has contributed to a 3.24 percent decline in the Nifty from its July highs, reflecting the nervousness in the broader market.    Which two stocks are you looking to buy for the coming week?    Shyam Metalics and Energy    On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a Cup and Handle pattern breakout, accompanied by robust volume, which adds credibility to the breakout. Importantly, the breakout candle is a large bullish candlestick, reflecting strong buying interest and conviction among market participants.    As the stock is trading at an all-time high level, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Given this strong technical setup, the stock is well-positioned for a potential continuation of its upward move in the coming sessions. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 975-965 level with a stop-loss of Rs 940. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,040 in the short term.    Cipla    The stock has registered a breakout above a downward sloping trendline on the daily chart, signaling a potential trend reversal. This breakout is further validated by volume activity, as the move was accompanied by volumes exceeding the 50-day average \u2014 a key confirmation of strength. Adding to the bullish sentiment, the stock has also managed to surpass both its short-term and long-term moving averages.    Notably, the daily RSI has also broken above its own falling trendline, reinforcing the view that momentum is shifting in favour of the bulls. This confluence of price and momentum breakouts suggests that the stock may be poised for a sustained upward move. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,540-1,530 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,480. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,620 in the short term.    Do you expect the rally in Torrent Pharma to continue next week?    Yes, the rally in Torrent Pharma is expected to continue next week. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a Stage-2 Cup pattern breakout, backed by strong volumes, indicating healthy participation. With the stock trading at all-time highs, there\u2019s no overhead supply to restrict further gains. Technically, all key moving averages are trending upwards, and momentum indicators are aligned in favour of the bulls. Notably, the daily RSI is in the super bullish zone, as per the RSI range shift principle, suggesting strong and sustained buying strength. Given this confluence of bullish signals, the stock is likely to maintain its northward momentum in the coming sessions.    Are you strongly bullish on Sharda Cropchem and Vimta Labs?    Yes, we are strongly bullish on both Sharda Cropchem and Vimta Labs. Over the past week, both stocks have significantly outperformed the broader market, showcasing impressive relative strength compared to frontline indices. This outperformance has been accompanied by robust volume activity, which reinforces the conviction behind the current upmove. Technically, both stocks are trading well above their key moving averages, and all major indicators and momentum oscillators are aligned in favour of the bulls. The price action, volume structure, and momentum setup collectively suggest that these stocks are well-positioned to extend their upward trajectory in the near term.

        "Description": "A Moneycontrol survey of eight analysts estimates Reliance\u2019s Q4 revenue to be Rs 2.38 lakh crore compared to Rs 2.37 lakh crore in year-ago period. EBITDA is expected to be around Rs 43,491.6 crore, up from Rs 42,516 crore a year ago",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Reliance Industries Ltd is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on April 25, with analysts projecting a mixed performance as softness in the oil-to-chemicals and oil &amp;amp; gas segment is expected to be offset by a hike in telecom tariffs and improving retail performance.    A Moneycontrol survey of eight analysts estimates Reliance\u2019s Q4 revenue to be Rs 2.38 lakh crore compared to Rs 2.37 lakh crore in year-ago period. EBITDA is expected to be around Rs 43,491.6 crore, up from Rs 42,516 crore a year ago. Net profit is estimated at Rs 18,820 crore, little changed from Rs 18,951 crore in the year ago. Profit was Rs 18,540 crore in the December quarter.        Elevated feedstock costs, led by a 28 percent increase in ethane prices from the December quarter and stable naphtha rates, alongside flat to declining petrochemical product prices, are expected to compress margins and weigh on the O2C segment\u2019s EBITDA. Weaker oil product cracks are likely to pressure refining margins. Despite this, continued processing of discounted crude from Russia (34 percent), Iraq (18 percent), and Venezuela (6 percent) is expected to support gross refining margins (GRM).    What factors could drive the earnings?    O2C Business: EBITDA is projected to decline by 14 percent from a year earlier and remain flat sequentially, affected by weak product cracks and petrochemical spreads. Benchmark Singapore GRMs have dropped 58 percent from a year earlier, reflecting global softness in product cracks.    Oil &amp;amp; Gas: EBITDA is likely to fall 9 percent from a year earlier and 8 percent sequentially, driven by lower output from the KG-D6 block, although deepwater gas prices have risen 2 percent year-on-year.    Digital Services: Jio\u2019s EBITDA is expected to increase by 16 percent year-on-year and 2 percent quarter-on-quarter, supported by higher ARPU (up 13 percent year-on-year and 1 percent quarter-on-quarter) following the tariff hike, as well as a marginal rise in subscriber base.    Retail Business: The retail segment is forecast to deliver a robust 11 percent year-on-year EBITDA growth on the back of increased store area, better margins, and improved realisations. However, sequential EBITDA may dip by 9 percent due to the tapering off of festive sales and a shorter quarter.    Investors are expected to focus on Reliance\u2019s IPO roadmap, with Jio eyeing a 2025 listing and retail to follow. Investors will also watch for updates on gains from discounted crude processing amid weak product cracks, 5G rollout, retail expansion, and new energy projects, along with commentary on KG-D6 production trends and exploration plans.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank  Axis Bank (Axis) reported disappointing Q1FY26 with a massive rise in gross/net slippages and credit costs. Axis, in its Q4FY25 call, without quantifying, had mentioned that it has tightened the upgrade and classification criteria (technical impact), which could adversely impact asset quality outcomes. The technical impact on gross slippages (INR 27.1bn), net slippages (INR 18.6bn) and credit costs (INR 8bn) is: 1) higher than our estimates; and more importantly 2) difficult to comprehend, in our view. Gross/net slippages jumped to ~3.1%/2.3% annualised, while credit costs spiked to 1.5%. RoA moderated to 1.5%, cushioned by treasury/fee and muted opex. NIM declined ~17bps QoQ to 3.8% and the bank retains its \u2018through the cycle\u2019 guidance of 3.8%. Axis now aims for outpacing the industry on loan growth in FY26 and continued muted opex in the near term. Retain BUY on valuations.  Outlook  We cut our target multiple to ~1.65x (~1.8x earlier); TP revised to INR 1,370 (INR 1,470 earlier). Maintain BUY on valuations, though we believe that the stock\u2019s returns are likely to be back-ended. Axis has seen higher churn at the senior level and we hope the bank addresses this before it starts impacting execution.

        "Content": "The shares of IT companies tumbled on May 22, tracking Wall Street peers over concerns of possible widening of US' federal deficit, pushing the Nifty IT index down nearly 1.3 percent.    US Republican lawmakers are currently finalizing a new budget proposal which includes tax cuts, however, investors worry that the package - facing significant disagreements over tax deductions - may enlarge the country's federal deficit. Concerns in the US bond market weighed on sentiment, coming close to the heels of last week\u2019s downgrade of US debt by Moody's.    The uncertainties have pushed the yields on US' long-term government bonds lower, leading to a widespread selloff on the Wall Street. The US market slump spilled over to Asia as well, with Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq, along with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbling over one percent each in morning trade.    Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty too closed in the red on Thursday, with IT being one of the worst performing sectors. Domestic IT companies derive a major portion of their revenue from the US, and concerns over US fiscal and economic health could impact business prospects of IT majors too.    Wipro shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent to close at Rs 246.05 apiece. Tech Mahindra shares also tumbled nearly 2 percent to end the session at Rs 1,572 apiece.    Persistent Sysytems, TCS and Infosys fell over 1 percent each, while HCL Tech, Mphasis and LTI Mindtree shares closed in the red with marginal losses.    The IT stocks have seen significant volatility recently. After a strong rise, the stocks significantly fell after rating agency Moody's cut US government's credit rating from AAA to AA1. It cited the ballooning fiscal deficits and the strain of refinancing existing debt amid elevated interest rates as the reasons for its downgrade.    The IT stocks will be kept under active watch, as they attract strong investor interest. &quot;For India, IT sector is important. It is what oil has been to Saudi Arabia,&quot; market expert Manish Chokhani said while speaking at the Mirae Asset Capital Markets Invest India Conference 2025.

During the quarter, the bank earned an interest income of Rs 1,19,666 crore as against Rs 1,11,043 crore a year ago.    The lender saw an improvement in asset quality, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) declining to 1.82% of the total advances in the fourth quarter from 2.24 % as at March-end 2024. Similarly, net NPAs eased to 0.47 per cent as against 0.57 per cent.    On a consolidated basis, SBI's net profit in the quarter fell 8 per cent to Rs 19,600 crore as against Rs 21,384 crore in the same period a year ago. Total income, however, increased to Rs 1,79,562 crore from Rs 1,64,914 crore.    For entire financial year 2024-25, the bank reported 16 per cent increase in profit on a standalone basis at Rs 70,901 crore as against Rs 61,077 crore in the previous year.    Besides, the board has approved raising equity capital of up to Rs 25,000 crore (including share premium) in one or more tranches during 2025-26 through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP)/ Follow on Public Offer (FPO) or any other mode.    SBI Chairman CS Setty said, &quot;Though the Indian economy is less impacted by tariffs, the uncertainty over tariffs will impact the economy and investment scenario.&quot;    &quot;Without raising capital, the bank's growth will not be impacted. Benign asset quality is likely to continue for more period,&quot; SBI Chairman CS Setty said.    &quot;Taxation benefits will help the lower end customers to rethink about personal loans,&quot; CS added.",

        "Date": "2025-07-22",
        "Description": "The consolidation phase is likely to continue until the index shows a strong and sustainable close above short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices fell by one-tenth of a percent on July 22, following a day of half a percent gains. The market breadth was dominated by bears, with 1,548 shares declining compared to 1,105 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation phase is likely to continue until the index shows a strong and sustainable close above short-term moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 763.3        After a decline from higher levels, HDFC Life has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Additionally, a sloping trendline breakout has occurred, accompanied by decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels, suggesting the onset of a new bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 735, the bullish outlook is likely to continue. If it surpasses this level, the stock could move up to Rs 815.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 815    Stop-Loss: Rs 735    Hindalco Industries | CMP: Rs 690        On the daily chart, Hindalco is forming a rising channel with a higher highs and higher lows pattern. The stock has shown a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Moreover, the RSI indicates potential for further upside momentum, which could fuel a bullish trend in the near future. For positional traders, Rs 665 is a decisive level. If the stock trades above this level, the uptrend is likely to continue, targeting Rs 740. However, if it closes below Rs 665, traders may prefer to exit long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 740    Stop-Loss: Rs 665    Indian Oil Corporation | CMP: Rs 152        After a gradual decline from higher levels, the downward momentum in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has halted. On the daily charts, the stock has reversed from its short-term moving average and found support, with decent volume activity. This formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 145 will be the key trend-deciding level for the bulls. If it sustains above this level, an uptrend toward Rs 163 is likely.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 163    Stop-Loss: Rs 145    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    Mahindra and Mahindra | CMP: Rs 3,257.2        Despite the Auto sector closing in the red, Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra managed to reach a fresh high of Rs 3,271.90, indicating strength in the stock. Since July 14, the stock has held above its prior day's low on a closing basis and has gained nearly 7%, suggesting a bullish bias. Additionally, the MACD recently gave a bullish crossover, reinforcing a positive outlook for the stock. For the momentum to remain positive, the stock needs to sustain above its fresh high of Rs 3,272, which would further boost bullish momentum. Hence, the current trend for Mahindra &amp;amp; Mahindra remains in favour of the bulls.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,375, Rs 3,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,160    Swiggy | CMP: Rs 417.15        In the previous session, Swiggy surged over 5% with a rise in volumes, breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern, with prices closing above the neckline near Rs 412. This pattern has been forming since February 2025. According to the three candlestick rules, the daily trend has shifted to the positive side. Additionally, Bollinger Bands are expanding, signaling that strong momentum may be seen in the upcoming sessions.    However, given the sharp rise over the past two days, the RSI is nearing overbought territory on the shorter time frame. Therefore, buying on dips appears to be a prudent strategy to capitalize on the ongoing trend. A dip toward Rs 410-415 could present a good buying opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 430, Rs 445    Stop-Loss: Rs 394    FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 220        Nykaa has been trading in a higher highs and higher lows structure within its upward-sloping channel since March 2025. At the beginning of July 2025, the stock found support at the channel and saw an 11% rise in a short span of time, signaling a strong bullish trend. Currently, the stock is trading near its previous swing high of Rs 220.40.    A decisive break above this level is necessary for upward momentum to continue. If this occurs, the stock is expected to move toward the channel's resistance, near Rs 240. Additionally, the ADX shows readings of 30, suggesting that good positive momentum is likely to persist in the stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 230, Rs 240    Stop-Loss: Rs 210    Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities    ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF | CMP: Rs 59.77        The FMCG sector appears to have bottomed out, with many large-cap FMCG stocks turning bullish on short-term charts. FMCG has underperformed the Nifty this calendar year, but a mean reversion and outperformance from the FMCG sector are expected going forward. We recommend going long on ICICI Prudential Nifty FMCG ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the FMCG sector.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 63    Stop-Loss: Rs 57.50    ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF | CMP: Rs 121.66        The NSE Consumption Index has been in a bullish trend, with higher tops and higher bottoms. Several consumption stocks in sectors like telecom, FMCG, and auto form the majority of the weight in this index. The index is currently above all key moving averages. We recommend going long in the ICICI Prudential Nifty India Consumption ETF to capitalize on our bullish view of the consumption sector.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 127    Stop-Loss: Rs 115    Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees | CMP: Rs 425.63        The Hang Seng, Hong Kong's equity market benchmark, has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily chart. The index has surpassed the crucial resistance of the previous swing high at 24,875. It is one of the best-performing indices globally year-to-date, and this trend is expected to continue. We recommend going long in the Nippon India ETF Hang Seng Bees to capitalize on our bullish view of the Hang Seng Index.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 460    Stop-Loss: Rs 405    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Reliance Power shares plunged 5 percent to get locked in the upper circuit at Rs 63.63 apiece on June 17, extending losses for the fourth consecutive session. The shares of the Anil Ambani-led company have dropped nearly 17 percent in the past four sessions now, after a significant bull run.    Reliance Power shares recently saw a significant surge, jumping by a whopping 132 percent in three months to hit a record high of Rs 76.49 apiece earlier this month. The shares gained nearly 70 percent in the past one month. However, investors may have now booked profits at the elevated levels, causing the decline in the share price.    Over 2.1 crore shares of the company have been involved in active trade so far during the day, and the stock currently has a P/E ratio of 9.40. Despite the recent downturn, the stock is still a whopping 147 percent higher than its 52-week low of Rs 25.75, which it had hit on July 23 last year.    Reliance Power on May 28 had announced that its subsidiary Reliance NU Energies has received a Letter of Award (LOA) for a 350 MW inter-state transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar power project coupled with a 175 MW/700 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) from Navratna PSU SJVN.    Reliance NU Energies had earlier emerged as the successful bidder in the auction for the project, with a fixed tariff of Rs 3.33/kWh for a period of 25 years. &quot;The project was part of a larger 1,200 MW solar + 600 MW/2,400 MWh BESS tender, which attracted participation from 19 developers, with 18 qualifying for the final e-reverse auction. The tender was oversubscribed by more than 4 times, reflecting heightened industry interest in dispatchable renewable energy solutions,&quot; the company said.    The latest project will add 600 MW of solar DC capacity and 700 MWh of BESS capacity to Reliance Power's portfolio. It further said that its total clean energy pipeline now stands at 2.4 GW of Solar DC capacity and over 2.5 GWH of BESS capacity, making it India's largest player in the integrated Solar + BESS segment.    &quot;The project reinforces Reliance Power\u2019s strategic commitment to renewable energy leadership, while delivering sustainable value creation across stakeholders. It marks a significant milestone in the company\u2019s strategic vision to transition toward cleaner energy sources and play a pivotal role in shaping the country\u2019s sustainable energy future,&quot; Reliance Power further said.

        "Author": "Hamsini Karthik",
        "Content": "Japanese financial conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) is back in the fray to acquire a controlling stake in Yes Bank. State Bank of India (SBI) has reopened talks with SMBC to pick up a controlling stake in the Mumbai headquartered lender, sources said.    While talks first started in 2024, this time, the deal terms have undergone some changes, sources said.    SBI, which holds a 23.97 percent stake in Yes Bank, is likely to sell up to 20 percent of its holding to SMBC. The Japanese major is also expected to infuse fresh capital of 6\u20137 percent. Upon fund infusion, SMBC may make an open offer to take its stake to 51 percent.    SBI is likely to tender its remaining shareholding through the open offer.    Other Yes Bank investors Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, which collectively hold a 7.36 percent stake, and private equity majors Advent International and Carlyle, who have a 9.2 percent and 6.84 percent holdings, respectively, are also expected to exit through the open offer.    Life Insurance Corporation of India holds a 3.98 percent stake in Yes Bank.    \u201cThis is the structure that has been presented to SMBC,\u201d said a banker aware of the matter, adding the Japanese company\u2019s response was awaited.    Emails sent to SBI and SMBC remained unanswered till the publishing of this article.    Some assurances have been extended to SMBC to ensure that the deal sails through smoothly, especially with respect to voting rights and controlling majority, sources said.    Deal talks with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), another Japanese player, and SMBC did not fructify last year, as both financial majors were seeking dispensation on voting right limits.    The buyers wanted the voting rights and shareholding at 51 percent, though Indian law limits the voting rights of promoters in a private sector bank at 26 percent.    \u201cSMBC is reconciled to the fact that this cannot be changed and has yet shown interest in Yes Bank,\u201d said the banker cited above. With a 51 percent shareholding, Yes Bank may be consolidated at its Japanese parent level, though it may have to seek some dispensations in its jurisdiction. \u201cThese factor are under consideration,\u201d the person added.    To have operational and management control, SMBC may nominate directors in key committees of the bank\u2019s board, including the nomination and remuneration committee (NRC). The NRC has a strong say in key managerial appointments including the chief executive officer.    \u201cOnce SMBC reverts on the proposed terms, the deal will be taken to the regulator for further consideration,\u201d said a senior official, adding it an agreement may be reached this fiscal if the Japanese firm is agreeable to shareholding and voting rights\u2019 laws.    After nearly seven years, SBI on May 3 announced a Rs 25,000-crore equity fund raise plan. Speaking at a post-earnings conference, chairman CS Setty said SBI would consider all option but refrained from giving any timelines. \u201cThat (fund raise) will depend on our business needs and market conditions,\u201d he said.",

        "Content": "The benchmark indices made a strong start to the week, with the Nifty 50 recording a 3.82 percent rally on May 12\u2014the biggest single-day gain since February 2021\u2014accompanied by strong market breadth. A total of 2,414 shares saw buying interest compared to 239 declining shares on the NSE. Overall, the trend remains positive, though some profit booking and consolidation in the upcoming sessions can't be ruled out after the robust gains of the previous session. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,626.9        Infosys is showing signs of a recovery trend on the monthly chart, forming a higher bottom pattern. The long lower wick in April indicates strong buying interest, followed by a bullish candle this month that has closed above the previous month's high\u2014signaling continued positive sentiment. On the weekly timeframe, the stock has formed a triple bottom and is now creating higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a trend reversal. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) has moved above its 9-period average after emerging from the oversold zone, indicating improving momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,806    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,545    Info Edge India | CMP: Rs 1,476        Info Edge India (Naukri) has shown strong price structure development on the monthly chart, with the previous resistance zone now acting as a support level. The stock has also witnessed a bullish mean reversion from the 26-month EMA. On the weekly scale, it has rebounded from the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement of the prior upmove from Rs 781 to Rs 1,817 and has recently broken above a three-week high, reinforcing the bullish outlook.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,653    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400    BHEL | CMP: Rs 232.95        Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) has displayed a bullish polarity shift on the monthly timeframe, where the previous resistance zones from 2012 and 2015 have now turned into a support area. This support also aligns with a bullish mean reversion near the 34-month EMA, from which the stock has shown positive price action with a higher low formation. On the weekly scale, the Super Trend indicator has turned bullish, and the RSI is inching higher\u2014currently at 54\u2014indicating improving momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 272    Stop-Loss: Rs 219    APL Apollo Tubes | CMP: Rs 1,712.8        APL Apollo Tubes is maintaining a strong uptrend on the monthly chart, forming higher highs and sustaining above its 12- and 26-week EMAs\u2014reflecting long-term strength and buyer support on dips. On the weekly timeframe, the stock has broken out of a downward-sloping channel with a bullish candlestick and a volume surge above the 10-week average, signaling renewed buying interest.    Supporting indicators such as a bullish MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) crossover and an RSI rising toward 60 further confirm building momentum and suggest potential for continued upside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,054    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,592    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Tata Technologies | CMP: Rs 701        Tata Technologies is approaching a significant technical juncture, supported by the alignment of critical time cycles and Fibonacci ratios. The ongoing setup fits within a 35\u201336-week cycle, resonating with the Fibonacci number 34\u2014often linked with cyclical turning points. The correction from A to B was 30%, followed by a 47.45% drop from C to D, giving a ratio of 1.58\u2014close to the Golden Ratio (1.618). In absolute terms, the price correction from C to D (Rs 539) versus A to B (Rs 416.60) yields a 1.27 ratio, again aligning with the Golden Ratio. Additionally, RSI bull divergence was observed on the daily scale, adding further confirmation. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 690\u2013705 zone, with an upside target of Rs 750.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 750    Stop-Loss: Rs 670    Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,258.4        Cyient is nearing a crucial technical zone that signals a potential trend reversal, supported by both time cycle and Fibonacci harmony. The stock is currently aligning with a 34-week time cycle, which corresponds to the Fibonacci number 34\u2014often associated with key turning points in harmonic analysis.    From a Fibonacci percentage standpoint, the decline from A to B was 32.18%, while the C to D correction was 49.43%. Their ratio (1.536) is close to the Golden Ratio (1.618), and its inverse (0.651) aligns with 0.618. In terms of price symmetry, the A\u2013B fall of Rs 778.75 and the C\u2013D drop of Rs 1,059.55 yield a ratio of 1.36\u2014again near 1.618\u2014confirming harmonic balance and a high-probability reversal zone. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,245\u20131,260 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,400    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170    Birlasoft | CMP: Rs 420.45        Birlasoft appears to evolve around a 427-calendar-day cycle, which aligns closely with a Gann Square of 144 (i.e., 144 \u00d7 3 = 427). This time confluence is forming near a major support level at Rs 330, adding strength to the view that this level could potentially mark a significant bottom. The alignment of time and price makes this a critical level to monitor for a possible trend reversal.    Furthermore, on the daily chart, an Inverse Head &amp;amp; Shoulders pattern has formed and the neckline has been breached with strong volume. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 425\u2013415 range.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 510    Stop-Loss: Rs 375    Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities    Chalet Hotels | CMP: Rs 870        Chalet Hotels has given a strong breakout from its triangular consolidation pattern, accompanied by a sharp surge in volumes. The RSI (14) on the daily timeframe is at 62, indicating strong momentum and underlying strength. The MACD has witnessed a bullish crossover, suggesting the stock can move towards Rs 925 and higher levels. A strict stop-loss at Rs 850 should be maintained to manage risk effectively.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 925    Stop-Loss: Rs 850    Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone | CMP: Rs 1,362.1        Adani Ports has given a strong breakout above its immediate resistance level of Rs 1,300, and is showing clear signs of momentum and strength. With RSI (14) positioned at 68, the momentum appears robust, and the stock looks poised for an upside move toward Rs 1,500 and beyond. The MACD also signals strong momentum. A strict stop-loss at Rs 1,290 should be maintained for risk management.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,500    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,290    Motilal Oswal Financial Services | CMP: Rs 736.1        Motilal Oswal has broken out above its immediate resistance level of Rs 704.65, supported by a sharp surge in volumes. The RSI (14) is placed at 61, indicating strong momentum, while the MACD shows a positive crossover, adding credibility to the breakout. An upside target of Rs 780 and above is expected, with a stop-loss at Rs 700 to limit downside risk.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 780    Stop-Loss: Rs 700    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Title": "How TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra fared in Q1FY26",
        "Date": "2025-07-25",
        "Description": "Infosys may have led the Tier-1 pack in Q1, but the bar was low, as macroeconomic conditions were challenging and client spending had not picked up significantly.",
        "Author": "Debangana Ghosh",
        "Content": "The first quarter of fiscal FY26 was a mixed bag for the top five Indian IT majors - Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra \u2013 as robust deal wins, margin expansion, and steady profit were offset by muted revenue growth and lacklustre hiring.    Infosys may have led the Tier-1 pack in the June quarter, but the bar was low amid challenging macroeconomic conditions and slow pick up in client spend.    Infosys outshines Tier-I peers    India\u2019s second-largest IT firm Infosys emerged as the best among the top five players. It was the only large player that believed the macroeconomic environment was \u2018more stable\u2019 than earlier. \u201cDiscussions on the economy worldwide have come to a more stable situation, but it\u2019s not fully settled,\u201d CEO and MD Salil Parekh said during the Q1FY26 earnings press conference on July 23.    Infosys beat Street estimates at a time when most of its peers missed. It was the only IT company among the top five to have posted a meaningful incremental revenue growth, at over Rs 1,300 crore in Q1FY26, while the IT sector\u2019s largest player TCS, posted a decline of over Rs 1,000 crore for the quarter.        Focus on operating margins     A mix of levers helped IT majors expand margins sequentially, barring HCLTech, as companies stayed focused on improving utilisation rates, cutting costs through cautious hiring, delayed wage hike, and even benefitting from cross-currency movements.    HCLTech was the only Tier-I IT firm to see a QoQ as well as YoY plunge in margins. The management highlighted that Q1FY26 is seasonally the weakest for HCLTech, unlike peers who usually post strong first-quarter earnings. HCLTech\u2019s margins came way below their own estimates, driven down by lower utilization rates as it was building capacity in March for specialised skills \u2013 as part of organisation-wide restructuring \u2014 that is further expected to impact margins in the following quarters. Consequently, HCLTech has reduced operating margin guidance by 100 bps to 17-18% for FY26.    \u201cThis utilization drop was also due to a ramp-down in specific areas like automotive. In addition, the people who were released due to productivity benefits could not be redeployed due to skill and location mismatch. The second aspect was a one-off impact from a client bankruptcy. And third and lastly, even though we have been hit by these unforeseen challenges, we remain committed to making investments in AI and go-to-market capabilities,\u201d HCLTech CEO and MD C Vijayakumar told analysts.    IT companies were also seen delaying wage hike cycles, citing an uncertain macro and demand environment, thus deferring the impact of increment on quarterly margins. Only Infosys among the top 5 rolled out wage hikes, while TCS, which usually starts its wage hike cycle by April 1 is yet to make a decision. A similar trend was seen in the commentaries of HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, who wouldn\u2019t take a call until October.    While speaking to analysts, TCS CFO Samir Seksaria pointed out that continued investments into people for long-term growth has been one of the key factors in having lower margins despite seeing a sequential increase.    \u201c\u2026if you look at it, the capacity versus the demand contraction mismatch leads to us carrying excess capacity or additional capacity, which should help us in our future demand,\u201d Seksaria said, adding that there\u2019s been a mismatch between demand and supply.        Demand-hiring delinks    IT companies have slowed down hiring amid macroeconomic uncertainties, clouding demand outlook due to US President Trump\u2019s tariff policies, though IT firms continued to report strong deal wins.    Only TCS and Infosys saw a positive headcount addition in Q1, but with a stark difference in the hiring numbers. TCS added 5,090 employees in Q1 while Infosys\u2019 headcount went up marginally by 210 employees.    TCS\u2019 Chief HR Officer, Milind Lakkad, said hiring and demand scenario have started to delink. \u201cHiring shouldn\u2019t be connected to quarterly growth. It is planned on a yearly basis,\u201d Lakkad said.    \u201cWe had earlier hired during the initial quarters then we faced some business challenges. That had caused some imbalance, but we are not that bothered as we will leverage this going forward,\u201d he added.    Tech Mahindra lost about 622 employees during the June quarter, and has no plans for immediate fresher hiring either, though quarterly deal wins have remained strong.    Tech Mahindra\u2019s CFO Rohit Anand said, \u201cWe'd hired close to 6,000 last year. So, we are working through the learning development platform absorption of that pool, right, within the ecosystem. So, that's the focus right now. And as we continue to drive more visibility and progress through the macro through the year, we'll drive that action more.\u201d    \u201cAs Mohit (Tech Mahindra CEO Mohit Joshi) mentioned, there's a new dynamic around how we look at our employee base collectively from an AI perspective as well, which is an advantage for us given the experience profile we have. So, we'll be evaluating that in a mix of AI, but generally we will hire more as we progress towards the year,\u201d Anand added.        High hopes on H2FY26?    While Q1 has remained muted for IT majors in terms of revenue growth, it diverges from the industry-wide trend of a strong orderbook.    According to Wipro CEO Srini Pallia, the discretionary spend is broadly being seen around data, AI, and modernisation.    TCS CEO K Krithivasan, after seeing a decline in revenue growth, said the second half of the fiscal year should be promising, especially for international business revenue. TCS, however, did point out some delays in deal closures and decision-making.    \u201cAs of the international revenue of FY26, I am still confident it will be better than the FY25 international revenue. But we are still trying to push the overall revenue to be much better in the coming quarters. I am still optimistic. This uncertainty cannot last long. The clarity should emerge and spending should come back,\u201d Krithivasan said.    He added, \u201cWe are very focused on the emerging markets as well, be it MEA (Middle East and Africa) or APAC (Asia Pacific), or LATAM (Latin America), outside of Australia. We are very keen to diversify our revenue stream as well.\u201d    Tech Mahindra is pinning its hopes on its strong deal pipeline converting into revenue from the second quarter onwards, and then subsequent growth in the second half of the fiscal.    For HCLTech\u2019s C Vijayakumar, \u201cmacros will play out differently in different verticals\u201d, and he expects the same to continue throughout the year.    \u201cWe are not expecting some recovery in Manufacturing and Life Sciences and Retail &amp;amp; CPG, but at the same time we expect Financial Services and Tech and Services to continue the discretionary spend. So, we are looking at whatever we are seeing now will continue during rest of the year,\u201d he said.    Wipro believes the discretionary spending environment has finally started to stabilise.    \u201cOne was hopeful perhaps that the start this calendar year that it would improve, but for the moment I think the way we are looking at this financial year is going to be stable. If we keep that assumption in mind, you should be able to see a much better conversion of some of these bookings into revenue,\u201d Wipro CFO Aparna Iyer told analysts during the earnings call last week.

        "Content": "The shares of IT companies declined in trade on July 9 as investors actively awaited the release of the first set to Q1 FY26 results from the pack. The fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty IT index down nearly half a percent to hover around 38,801 in the morning.    Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is scheduled to release its results for the first quarter of the ongoing financial year 2025-2026 tomorrow (July 10), effectively opening the earnings season for the IT pack.    What to expect from TCS Q1 results?    Analysts have suggested that the IT sector may see a soft earnings season, amid global uncertainties. Equirius Capital expects TCS' US$ revenue to dip sequentially by 0.4 percent in CC terms. It noted that tepid growth will largely be driven by expected  ramp down in BSNL deal and some softness in sales growth in international markets. The firm expects EBIT margins to improve marginally as soft demand will likely result into lower operating. &quot;Equirus expects material dip in TCV QoQ given seasonal softness,&quot; it added.    Axis Securities expects TCS revenue to fall 0.3 percent sequentially in Q1, driven by the impact from BSNL deal. &quot;EBIT margin to remain flattish by 60 bps during the quarter,&quot; it said.    Ashika Institutional Equity Research expects TCS to report a sequential decline of 0.5 percent in USD revenue, amid the likely revenue impact of the BSNL deal ramp down.    What to watch out for in TCS Q1 results?    The key things to watch out for in TCS quarterly show include demand outlook in BFSI, retail, communication, hi-tech and other key segments, as well as any impact of volatile macro environment and tariff issues on demand. The firm's deal pipeline, outlook on CY25E/FY26E IT budgets, any further update on growth strategies as well as possible wage hike and new deal with BSNL will be in focus.    IT stocks in red    HCL Tech shares were the top loser on the index, dropping over 1 percent to trade at Rs 1,688 apiece.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Domestic brokerage Nuvama Institutional Equities gave Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) its highest target price on the Street, after reiterating its bullishness following the launch of RIL's solar modules.    The brokerage raised its target price on Reliance Industries to Rs 1,801 per share, reiterating its 'buy' call. At 12.50 p.m., shares of the conglomerate were quoting Rs 1,529, higher by 1.9 percent.    Reliance Industries announced the start of its first line of HJT (heterojunction solar panels) module manufacturing facility of 1GW, which can be scaled up in phases to fully integrated 10GW by early-CY26E.    According to the brokerage, its channel checks with key industry participants reveal that RIL has offered to sell its HJT modules in the lucrative domestic market since the rollout of its power generation business is some time away.    When compared to solar power players such as Waaree Energies or Premier Energies solar  module/cell capacity, RIL\u2019s fully integrated solar equipment manufacturing facility could command a much higher EV.    This, in turn, could trigger a valuation re-rating for Reliance Industries, similar to the trend seen post-Jio\u2019s launch in 2017. &quot;RIL\u2019s New Energy rollout shall not only add 50 percent-plus to PAT, but also rerate valuations, including the Oil to Chemicals (O2C) business given its net zero-carbon target by 2035,&quot; said Nuvama.    At 10GW capacity, the HJT module manufacturing facility could add Rs 3,800 crore to RIL's net profit, which would be around six percent of the firm's FY25 PAT.    At its AGM in August 2024, RIL had guided for a remarkable surge in the New Energy business with expectation of its profitability equalling O2C profitability in the next five\u2013seven years. O2C is RIL\u2019s largest profit base currently, contributing two\u2013fifths of EBITDA and more than half of attributable PAT.    In addition to integrated solar facilities, RIL plans to set up a 30GWh battery facility. Green hydrogen and electrolyser manufacturing are on track with the company announcing a technology tie-up with Nel ASA.

        "Description": "IT stocks: Tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed at a record high level following the US Fed chief's testimony.",
        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "Shares of IT companies were higher on June 25 as market participants saw US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before Congressional committee as dovish, supportive of a rate cut in 2025.    The sharp rise in the share prices pushed Nifty IT index up nearly 1.7 percent to hover around 39,065 in the afternoon trade. The sectoral index has now extended gains for a second consecutive session and is currently one of the top gaining sectors.    After Powell's testimony, several analysts increased expectations of a rate cut as soon as July, or in September. They also estimated another rate cut to follow during the course of the year. This increase in hopes for further rate cuts boosted the shares of IT companies, who derive a major portion of their revenues from the US economy.    While testifying before the Committee on Financial Services, Powell said the US economy is in a solid position, despite heightened uncertainty. &quot;The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2 percent longer-run objective. We are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate,&quot; he said.    Powell, however, reiterated that higher tariffs could hike inflation. &quot;I think if it turns out that inflation pressures remain contained we will get to a place where we cut rates sooner than later,&quot; he said.    Mphasis shares were the top gainer on the index, jumping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs2,753 apiece. Heavyweight Infosys shares jumped over 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,618 apiece. LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra (TechM) shares gained around 2 percent each, while Coforge, HCL Tech and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) shares rose over 1 percent each. Persistent Systems shares were trading in the green with marginal gains.    Wall Street too cheered the increased hopes of two rate cuts later this year, with the Tech-heavy Nasdaq at record high following the testimony.    Powell's testimony comes after severe backlash from US President Donald Trump, who called him a &quot;very dumb, hardheaded person&quot; for not cutting rates. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that Europe has had 10 rate cuts, while America had none, despite there being &quot;no inflation&quot; in the &quot;great economy&quot;. &quot;We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus. What a difference this would make. If things later change to the negative, increase the Rate,&quot; he said.    Trump further wrote, &quot;I hope Congress really works this very dumb, hardheaded person, over. We will be paying for his incompetence for many years to come. THE BOARD SHOULD ACTIVATE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!&quot;    (With inputs from Reuters)",

        "Title": "Hindustan Unilever Q1 Preview: Profit likely to remain flat as margins may see sharp contraction",
        "Date": "2025-07-29",
        "Description": "According to Moneycontrol's poll, Hindustan Unilever will report flat net profit at Rs 2,557 crore for the quarter ended June.",
        "Author": "Zoya Springwala",
        "Content": "One of India\u2019s largest consumer staples firm Hindustan Unilever Ltd. is set to report its earnings for the first quarter of the the current fiscal year on July 31, 2025. Rising commodity prices, increased competition, and lagging urban demand are expected to result in the FMCG giant seeing tepid earnings for the quarter.    According to a Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages, Hindustan Unilever is likely to report revenue growth in low single-digits, higher by 4 percent on-year, at Rs 16,014 crore, as against Rs 15,339 crore in the June quarter of the previous year. Net profit is likely to come in at Rs 2,557 crore, down 0.4 percent from Rs 2,572 crore from the corresponding quarter last year.        Earnings estimates of analysts polled by Moneycontrol are in a narrow range, so any positive or negative surprises may elicit a sharp reaction in the stock. The most optimistic estimate sees HUL\u2019s net profit rising 1.6 percent on-year, but the most pessimistic projection, rolled out by Kotak Institutional Equities, suggests that net profit might fall 2.2 percent YoY.    What factors are impacting the earnings?    Volumes    Hindustan Unilever\u2019s revenue is likely to remain flat on account of subdued performance across categories, as urban demand sees significant stress.    Brokerages noted that demand trends remained consistent QoQ with muted growth, and rural areas continued to outperform urban areas. &quot;There have not been any change in urban/rural demand versus last quarter. We expect Q1 to be largely in line with management's guidance on Q4 call,&quot; said Kotak Institutional Equities.    Segmental performance    According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the Home Care (HC)s segment's growth will clock in at 2.5 percent year-on-year (versus 1.8 percent in Q4), as volume growth will be offset by negative pricing and higher promotional intensity.    &quot;In Home Care, negative pricing for the entire quarter is likely versus one month of negative pricing in Q4FY25. However, we do see this Home Care price intervention as a driver of volume growth,&quot; added Nuvama Institutional Equities.    Beauty &amp;amp; Personal Care (BPC) revenues will see 5 percent year-on-year (versus 3.7 percent in Q4), aided by price hikes in soaps. The Foods &amp;amp; Refreshments (F&amp;amp;R) segment may report 2.8 percent growth (versus a 0.4 percent decline in Q4), driven by price hikes in tea.    Margins    According to expectations, gross margins are likely to contract as a result of increasing consumer protection. Brokerages project that advertising and promotional spends will be up to 11 percent of sales in the quarter.    This impact will flow through to the EBITDA, leading to an EBITDA margin contraction. While Moneycontrol's estimate suggests EBITDA margin may contact 90 basis points, the range is between 70-110 basis points of contraction.    What to look out for in the quarterly show?    The key focus will be on HUL's growth outlook, and experts will be watching closely for commentary on inflation and pricing outlook in both soaps and tea. Additionally, demand recovery in urban consumption will be eyed.

        "Date": "2025-06-22",
        "Description": "Given the current chart structure and improving momentum indicators, Bank Nifty is likely to continue its upward move and may test the 56,800 level in the near term with a potential extension toward 57,500, Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities said.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities believes the momentum in Bank Nifty remains strong, particularly led by private sector banks. &quot;Given the current chart structure and improving momentum indicators, Bank Nifty is likely to continue its upward move and may test the 56,800 level in the near term with a potential extension toward 57,500,&quot; he said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    He recommended buying Mahindra and Mahindra, and Indus Towers for next week. &quot;M&amp;amp;M has given a downward sloping trendline breakout along with robust volume, while Indus Towers has given a falling channel breakout on a daily scale supported by robust volume,&quot; said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    Further, he remains constructive on both Waaree Energies and Bharat Electronics at current levels, and bullish on both Bharti Airtel and MCX India, as their recent price action suggests that the uptrend is still in its early stages.    Do you expect the Nifty to surpass and sustain above previous week\u2019s high of 25,222 in the coming week?    Over the past 28 trading sessions, the benchmark index Nifty has remained locked within a narrow range of 25,222 to 24,462. Interestingly, 16 of these sessions witnessed a gap-up or gap-down opening, underscoring the presence of heightened intraday volatility despite the broader index moving sideways. This choppy movement within a tight band has offered limited opportunities for directional trades, keeping traders on the edge.    However, bulls took charge in the final trading session of the week, helping Nifty close with weekly gains of 1.59%. With this strong performance, the index has decisively ended above the psychological milestone of 25,000. Heavyweight stocks, especially Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel, were key drivers of the upmove. Notably, Nifty closed near the weekly high, further reinforcing bullish sentiment.    From a technical standpoint, the prolonged phase of consolidation has notably impacted key indicators. The upward slope of the short and medium-term moving averages has slowed down, reflecting a loss of momentum. Simultaneously, the daily RSI continues to move sideways, in line with the RSI range shift concept that suggests a lack of directional bias. Further, the trend strength indicator, i.e., ADX, is currently quoting near the 13 level, which was the lowest level since July 2024, which shows a lack of strength in either direction.    Moreover, the Bollinger bands on the daily chart have contracted significantly \u2014 a setup known in technical terms as a Bollinger Band Squeeze. This formation typically occurs when volatility drops to low levels and the price trades within compressed bands, often preceding a sharp breakout or breakdown.    Given these technical cues, a significant directional move in the Nifty could be on the horizon over the next few trading sessions, potentially breaking the current deadlock. Traders may consider staying alert for any price expansion outside the range to catch the emerging trend early.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 24,880-24,850 will act as immediate support for the index. While, on the upside, the zone of 25,200-25,250 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the 25,250 level will lead to resume its northward journey. In that case, it is likely to test the level of 25,500, followed by 25,700 in the short term.    Have you observed any recent changes in FII positioning or behaviour?    Yes. FIIs have turned buyers in the Indian market over the last four consecutive trading sessions. Notably, this also marks the fourth straight month of net buying, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and global tariff concerns. While the buying volume remains lower compared to previous sell-offs, the shift in sentiment is clearly visible, indicating a gradual return of confidence.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Mahindra and Mahindra (M&amp;amp;M)    The Nifty Auto has been strongly outperformed frontline indices in the last week, and currently, it is on the verge of giving trendline breakout. M&amp;amp;M has given a downward sloping trendline breakout along with robust volume. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is surged above 60 mark, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,190-3,160 level with a stop-loss of Rs 3,060 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 3,400 in the short term.    Indus Towers    On Friday, the stock has given a falling channel breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising mode, and they are in the desired sequence, which suggests the trend is strong. The momentum indicators also suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 405-400 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 385 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 440 in the short term.    Are you a strong buyer in Waaree Energies and Bharat Electronics at current levels?    Yes, we remain constructive on both Waaree Energies and Bharat Electronics at current levels and believe they are well-positioned to extend their upward momentum in the near term.    Bharat Electronics (BEL) is trading at an all-time high, reflecting strong underlying strength. With all key moving averages aligned positively and momentum indicators continuing to point higher, the stock is clearly in a strong uptrend. The lack of historical resistance further supports the bullish outlook.    Waaree Energies, on the other hand, is showing signs of a potential breakout. It is currently hovering near a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart, and a close above this trendline could trigger the next leg of the rally. Notably, the stock witnessed volumes above its 50-day average on Friday, suggesting smart money accumulation ahead of a possible breakout. A decisive move above the trendline could lead to significant upside in the short term.    Are you still bullish on Bharti Airtel and MCX India, given their recent sharp rallies following strong breakouts?    Yes, we remain bullish on both Bharti Airtel and MCX India, as their recent price action suggests that the uptrend is still in its early stages. Both stocks have delivered strong breakouts on the daily chart, supported by robust volumes\u2014an indication of strong institutional participation and broad-based buying interest.    From a technical standpoint, the current chart structure, along with positive momentum indicators, reinforces the likelihood of continued strength. In both cases, price action is supported by rising moving averages and healthy consolidation prior to the breakout, which further validates the sustainability of the ongoing rallies. We expect both stocks to maintain their outperformance in the near term.    Do you believe momentum remains strong in the Bank Nifty, especially within the Private Bank Index, which has outperformed the PSU Bank Index?    Yes, we believe the momentum in Bank Nifty remains strong, particularly led by private sector banks, which have continued to outperform their PSU counterparts. The index recently found support near its 34-day EMA and rebounded, indicating buyers are defending key moving averages. On Friday, Bank Nifty broke out of a three-day consolidation phase and closed higher by 1.22% further confirming short-term strength.    Technically, the daily RSI has formed a base near the 50 mark and is now approaching the 60 zone with upward momentum signaling a strengthening bullish setup. The index is also trading above its key short and medium-term moving averages supporting the positive outlook.    Given the current chart structure and improving momentum indicators, Bank Nifty is likely to continue its upward move and may test the 56,800 level in the near term with a potential extension toward 57,500. On the downside, the 55,600\u201355,500 zone will act as a crucial support area.    Do you anticipate a flag breakout in the Nifty Auto Index sooner rather than later?    Yes, we do. The Nifty Auto Index is currently approaching a downward-sloping trendline resistance on the daily chart and appears poised for a breakout. The index is trading above both its short and long-term moving averages, indicating a strong underlying trend.    Moreover, the daily RSI is rising and is on the verge of crossing the 60 mark, which reflects improving bullish momentum. Given the constructive price setup and strengthening indicators, we believe the Nifty Auto Index is likely to witness an upside breakout soon, with auto stocks expected to outperform in the short term.

        "Content": "According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, technical structure indicates that the upside momentum is losing steam, and Nifty is likely to enter a consolidation phase in the coming sessions as the market digests recent gains.    In the case of Bank Nifty, he believes the presence of strong support levels and overall positive structure suggests that the index is unlikely to undergo a deep correction in the immediate term.    Meanwhile, the FII data points toward a constructive yet balanced approach, where buying interest in cash markets is complemented by a guarded view in futures, indicating optimism with a layer of prudence, said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview with Moneycontrol.    He picks Mphasis and Grasim Industries for next week.    Do you think the Nifty has made a short-term top and will consolidate for a couple of weeks before finding a firm direction?    The benchmark index, Nifty, extended its upside journey this week (ended April 25), continuing the sharp rally that began from the low of 21,743.65. Over the course of just 12 trading sessions, the index surged more than 2,600 points, reflecting strong bullish momentum. However, this rally hit a brief pause amid anticipated geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, triggering a minor throwback.    Notably, the throwback was arrested near a key technical support \u2014 the neckline of a double bottom pattern, which coincides with the 8-day EMA. This level acted as a cushion, helping the index recover slightly before eventually closing the week at 24,039, registering a modest gain of 0.79 percent. On the weekly chart, Nifty has formed a small-bodied candle with a long upper shadow, a classic indication of selling pressure at higher levels. While the index remains above its short and long-term moving averages, it\u2019s important to note that the slope of short-term averages is flattening, hinting at waning momentum.    From an indicator perspective, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) remains in bullish territory, though it has started to trend lower, while the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram has declined for the last two sessions, both suggesting fading bullish strength. Overall, the technical structure indicates that the upside momentum is losing steam, and Nifty is likely to enter a consolidation phase in the coming sessions as the market digests recent gains.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 24,350-24,380 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. If the index sustains above 24,380 levels, then we may witness a sharp upside rally up to the level of 24,600, followed by the 24,850 level in the short term. On the downside, the zone of 23,800-23,750 will act as important support for the index as the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward move (21,744-24,365) is placed in that region. If the index slips below 23,750 levels, then the next crucial support is placed at the 23,350 levels.    How are the FIIs positioning themselves after the recent rally?    Over the last eight consecutive trading sessions, FIIs have emerged as net buyers in the Indian equity markets, signaling renewed confidence in domestic fundamentals. This buying spree reflects positive sentiment towards Indian equities.    In the derivatives segment, the FII long-short ratio in index futures currently stands at 37.63 percent, suggesting a moderately cautious stance. While it\u2019s not overly bullish, it indicates a gradual unwinding of short positions and buildup of long positions \u2014 a sign that FIIs are selectively participating in the uptrend but are still hedging against near-term volatility.    Overall, the FII data points toward a constructive yet balanced approach, where buying interest in cash markets is complemented by a guarded view in futures, indicating optimism with a layer of prudence.    What are your top two stock picks for the coming week?    Mphasis    The Nifty IT has witnessed a strong rebound last week. It has strongly outperformed frontline indices. The stock has surged above its short-term moving averages, i.e., 20 and 50-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) levels. These averages are starting to edge higher, which is a bullish sign. Further, the daily RSI has surged above the 60 mark, and it is on a rising trajectory. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its northward journey and test the level of Rs 2,800 in the short term. On the downside, the zone of Rs 2,420-2,400 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.    Grasim Industries    The stock is in an uptrend as it marks the sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms. Also, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. Most noteworthy, recently, the daily RSI took support near the 60 level and witnessed a rebound, which is a bullish sign as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 2,740-2,720 level with a stop-loss of Rs 2,640. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,900 in the short term.    Are you bullish on UltraTech Cement and ICICI Bank?    UltraTech Cement    The stock is in a strong uptrend as it marks the sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms. Also, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is in a bullish zone, and it is rising mode, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its northward journey in the short term.    ICICI Bank    After registering a high of Rs 1,436, the stock has witnessed a throwback. The throwback was halted near the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally (Rs 1,265-Rs 1,436), and it coincides with the 20-day EMA level. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. The daily RSI is in bullish territory. Going ahead, any sustainable move above the level of Rs 1420 will lead to resume its northward journey.    Do you expect a major breakout in the Nifty FMCG index in May?    No, a major breakout in the Nifty FMCG index is unlikely in May, as the weekly chart suggests a short-term consolidation phase. The index is expected to remain rangebound between 55,500 and 58,100. A decisive breakout or breakdown beyond this range could trigger a strong trending move in either direction.    Are technical indicators suggesting that the Nifty Bank may not undergo a major correction despite near-term consolidation?    Yes, technical indicators currently point towards a phase of consolidation rather than a major correction for Nifty Bank. The banking benchmark index has outperformed frontline indices in recent sessions and even registered a fresh all-time high of 56,098.70 during the first half of last week. Although the index witnessed a throwback after its peak, it managed to find support at the 8-day EMA, a sign of underlying strength.    On the weekly chart, a small-bodied candle with both upper and lower shadows suggests some indecision at elevated levels, calling for near-term caution. However, the broader structure remains intact, with the index trading well above both its short and long-term moving averages \u2014 a distinctly bullish signal.    While the daily RSI remains in the bullish zone, it is showing signs of easing, hinting at a possible pause or consolidation following the recent rally. Still, the presence of strong support levels and overall positive structure suggests that the index is unlikely to undergo a deep correction in the immediate term.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 54,200-54,100 will act as immediate support for the index. Any sustainable move below the level of 54,100 will lead to further correction up to the level of 53,400. While on the upside, the zone of 55,500-55,600 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 55,600 will lead to resuming its northward journey. In that case, the index is likely to test the level of 56,300, followed by 57,000 in the short term.

The stock is showing marginal positive movement in today's trade, with respect to the previous close, and is included as one of the stocks in the benchmark Nifty 50 index.    Tata Consultancy Services, a Nifty 50 constituent, has demonstrated consistent financial performance.

        "Date": "2025-06-18",
        "Description": "Market consolidation is expected to continue with the focus now shifting to the outcome of the US Federal Reserve meeting. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices closed lower after a day of rally, with the Nifty 50 falling 0.4 percent amid geopolitical tensions on June 17. Market breadth was weak, as about 1,761 shares saw selling pressure compared to 828 advancing shares on the NSE. Market consolidation is expected to continue with the focus now shifting to the outcome of the US Federal Reserve meeting. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    PB Fintech | CMP: Rs 1,950.1        On the daily scale, PB Fintech is trading within a rising channel formation, characterized by a higher high and higher low series. The stock has witnessed a steady recovery from trendline support levels. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is indicating further upside from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the near term. For positional traders, Rs 1,880 is the decisive level. Trading above Rs 1,880 will likely continue the uptrend toward Rs 2,080. However, if the stock closes below Rs 1,880, traders may consider exiting long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,080    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,880    Indian Bank | CMP: Rs 634        Following a strong up move, Indian Bank is currently taking a breather and has been in a consolidation phase over the last few sessions. The rangebound structure suggests a bullish continuation chart formation. Moreover, the stock has closed comfortably above its short-term moving average, indicating that it may soon resume its uptrend. For the next few sessions, Rs 610 will be the trend-deciding level. If it sustains above this level, a further move toward Rs 675 can be expected.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 675    Stop-Loss: Rs 610    Persistent Systems | CMP: Rs 6,068        Persistent Systems has given a breakout from an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily charts. Sustaining above this breakout level suggests the beginning of a new leg of uptrend. As long as the stock trades above Rs 5,850, the uptrend is likely to continue, with potential upside toward Rs 6,490. On the flip side, fresh selling pressure may only emerge if the stock falls below Rs 5,850.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 6,490    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,850    Nandish Shah, Senior Technical and Derivative analyst at HDFC Securities    Dee Development Engineers | CMP: Rs 289.1        The short-term trend of Dee Development Engineers remains positive, with the stock trading above its 5-, 11-, and 20-day EMAs. Since February 2025, the stock has been forming a bullish higher top\u2013higher bottom pattern on the daily chart. Accumulation is evident, as up-day volumes have been consistently higher than down-day volumes in recent weeks. The RSI oscillator is in a rising mode and currently above 60, confirming strength in the ongoing bullish trend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 310, Rs 325    Stop-Loss: Rs 270    Zensar Technologies | CMP: Rs 875.6        Zensar Technologies has broken out from a downward sloping trendline on the daily chart with higher volumes.

        "Date": "2025-02-12",
        "Description": "Brokerage Investec said that the new tax bill is not expected to change the preferential tax rates that apply to life insurance companies, instead keeping a status-quo, thus removing a major overhang for the sector.",

        "Content": "Shares of leading private life insurers saw strong gains on February 12, after an Investec note said the new Income Tax Bill - to be tabled on Thursday - will not change the preferential corporate tax rate for the sector.    Brokerage Investec said that the new tax bill is not expected to change the preferential tax rates that apply to life insurance companies, instead keeping a status-quo, thus removing a major overhang for the sector.    The Corporate Tax that life insurers are required to pay is much lower than what businesses in other sectors pay. Equity analysts had expressed concern over whether the new Income Tax Bill would change this provision for life insurance companies, as it may have a negative impact of the tax liability.    Bajaj Finserv, which provides both life and general insurance, was the top gainer on Sensex and Nifty 50, rising nearly 3 percent to close at 1,792 apiece. The stock was a strong contributor to the day's gain on the index.    Bajaj Finserv shares are currently over 26 percent higher than their 52-week low of Rs 1,419 apiece. The stock, however, is still down nearly 11 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 2,029.9 apiece.    SBI Life Insurance shares surged over 2 percent to close at Rs 1,448 apiece, with a significant surge in trading volumes. Nearly 15.9 lakh shares were involved in active trade on February 12, which is 1.24 times higher than its 10-day average volume.    Despite the surge, SBI Life shares are hovering near its 52-week low of Rs 1,307.70 apiece. The stock is still 25 percent lower than its 52-week high of Rs 1,936 apiece, which it had hit in September 2024.    HDFC Life shares also saw strong gains, rising nearly 2 percent to close at Rs 628.85 apiece. The stock is currently higher than its 50-day moving average.    Also Read: Bajaj Finserv may break ties with Allianz in H1CY25, possibly as soon as March-end    While shares of leading life insurers ended higher, LIC shares sharply fell to a new 52-week low of Rs 776 apiece.

        "Description": "Reliance's ambition for deep-tech began with the telecom foray, said Mukesh Ambani, when Jio launched 5G in 2021, building every aspect of the service within the company.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries, shared a bold vision of the future of the company during an interview to McKinsey and Company's Leading Asia series on June 25, and said the group intends to become a deep-tech and advanced manufacturing company.    Underscoring the changing technological landscape of the world, Ambani said the key challenge for the next generation will be in succeeding in this new order. &quot;The fact that the technology landscape is changing at an exponential speed is self-evident. I think that the big challenge will be in the confidence of the next generation to succeed in this new landscape,&quot; Mukesh Ambani said in the interview published on June 25.    Read More: \u2018Reliance is an institution that will last beyond us\u2019: Mukesh Ambani on his father\u2019s vision    This ambition for deep-tech began with the telecom foray, said Ambani, when Jio launched 5G in 2021, building every aspect of the service within the company. &quot;We built everything ourselves, end to end\u2014the core, the hardware, the software, every single piece. We used Ericsson and Nokia to help us on 20 percent, just to make sure that the 80 percent that we put in was good,&quot; Ambani told McKinsey. The leader of one of India\u2019s largest and most profitable private company had told his team to be 'better than these guys', while staying humble. &quot;I also wanted to make sure that our people were not too full of themselves.&quot; The technological ability of Jio helped the company offer unique services in the market.    This desire to develop technology stemmed from the era when the landscape was subjected to a lot of licences for the technology that Reliance needed. &quot;When we grew up, we were the users of technology, and it was clear that we had to license technology from abroad to ensure high quality. But we were subjugated to so many licenses. It was also high risk because, at the end of the day, if a plan didn\u2019t work, you could lose your shirt,&quot; said Ambani. He encouraged his leadership to be 'owners of technology' to become innovators.    Reliance has set its purpose in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) game by choosing to develop things that are 'downstream' and avoid the high-risk GPU game, he added. &quot;Our big purpose is to solve the complex problems before society and create wealth for the nation and the people. For this, we need not go into the high-risk GPU game. Let\u2019s do everything downstream,&quot; Mukesh Ambani told McKinsey.    Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

        "Description": "HUL sees signs of a gradual consumption recovery aided by macroeconomic tailwinds, along with portfolio transformation.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "One of India's largest fast-moving consumer goods companies Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) flagged an improving consumption environment on a sequential basis, as demand trends have shown positive signs of growth. &quot;We are seeing encouraging macroeconomic conditions,&quot; said CEO Rohit Jawa in the post-earnings analyst call on July 31.    He added that the Reserve Bank of India has reduced repo rate by 100 basis points since January 2025, injecting greater liquidity into the system. Retail inflation has moderated to 2.1 percent as of June, its lowest level since 2019.    This, along with the recent income tax relief measures, are expected to positively impact disposable income and consumer sentiment. Additionally, the Indian Met Department forecast of an above-average monsoon bodes well for rural demand.    &quot;Collectively, these tailwinds are helping to sustain the gradual recovery in consumption demand in the country. Consequently, consumption demand trends for last three months reflected a sequential improvement. However, at a MAT level, the consumption environment remained stable, with rural demand continuing to grow ahead of urban demand,&quot; added HUL.    HUL added that it is seeing tangible results from its strategic shift towards future-core categories and market-making segments, marking a significant transformation in its portfolio. Over the past two years, the company has recorded an estimated 500 basis points shift in this direction, driving a more resilient and consistent growth path.    Despite a subdued consumption environment, HUL has maintained mid-single-digit volume growth for five consecutive quarters. The company attributes this performance to its disciplined execution, strategic choices, and focus on strengthening key categories such as laundry, skin cleansing, and hair care. HUL also noted a recovery in market share, particularly after the temporary dip observed during the deflationary cycle.    Looking ahead, the company expects the first half of the current financial year to perform better than the latter half of the previous one. If commodity prices remain stable, HUL anticipates low single-digit price growth. It remains committed to improving gross margins sequentially, with a plan to reinvest those gains across the profit and loss statement.    &quot;We will sustain investments across the P&amp;amp;L, particularly in channels of the future, multi-year market-making platforms, and strategic capabilities needed for portfolio transformation,&quot; the company said.    HUL expects its EBITDA margin to remain in the 22 to 23 percent range and remains focused on driving competitive, volume-led growth across its portfolio by continuing to invest in brands and strategic priorities.    Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Thursday reported a 6 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 2,768 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, aided by lower tax expenses and volume-led sales growth across key categories.    Revenue (total sales) grew 5 percent to Rs 16,323 crore, with underlying volume growth (UVG) at 4 percent and underlying sales growth (USG) at 5 percent, HUL said in a stock exchange filing.

        "Content": "Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd extended their post-March quarter earnings' gains on April 29, adding Rs 1.4 lakh crore to the market capitalisation in two days. The conglomerate reported a 2.4 percent rise in the March quarter net profit, thus beating earnings estimates.    A total of 64.15 lakh shares changed hands of Reliance Industries which is a constituent of BSE Sensex generating a total turnover of Rs 900.85 crore. In volume terms, over 3.25 crore shares of the company were traded on the NSE with a traded value of Rs 4,541.69 crore.    On April 29, the blue-chip stock climbed 2.2 percent to settle at Rs 1,398.9 per share on the NSE.    On the BSE, it surged 2.77 percent to a high of Rs 1406.4, it's highest level since October 2024. The stock gained 20 percent in the last 20 sessions.    On April 28, the stock surged 5.1 percent, its biggest single-day gain since June 2024.    The shares of the oil-to-chemicals conglomerate RIL have been on uptrend for the last two trading sessions and are up over 8 percent during this period. The company's total market valuation has jumped to over Rs 19 lakh crore.    The index heavyweight emerged as the biggest gainer among the Sensex and Nifty firms on Monday and continued to be biggest benchmark gainer on Tuesday too.    A sharp uptick in the shares of the company was seen after the net profit attributable to shareholders grew 2.4 percent to Rs 19,407 crore for Q4 FY25, beating Street expectations, as a result of lower depreciation, interest and tax rate. Revenue for the three months ended March 31 climbed 8.8 percent from a year ago to Rs 2.88 lakh crore, driven by company\u2019s digital services, retail and oil-to-chemicals business.    Brokerages have also hiked their target prices following its March quarter earnings report, as a result of its robust performance across segments and higher-than-anticipated results for the O2C segment.    Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said, segment-wise, it expects Jio to be the biggest growth driver with 21 percent annual EBITDA growth over FY25-27, driven by one more tariff hike, market share gains in wireless, and ramp-up of the homes and enterprise business.    Japan\u2019s Nomura Holdings noted a few key triggers which will drive growth for Reliance Industries in the near term: scale-up of the new energy business, upcoming tariff hikes for Jio, and potential IPO/listing for Jio, which will drive value-unlocking for RIL.

This includes strategic initiatives on multiple fronts, including investing in new-tech areas, entering new markets, deploying AI at scale for our clients and ourselves, deepening our partnerships, creating next-gen infrastructure, and realigning our workforce model,&quot; the company had said last month as the news of layoffs shook the IT industry    Interestingly, few weeks before the layoff announcement, the company had said \u201cit hasn\u2019t been able to take any decision on its wage hike cycle\u201d.    TCS Q1FY26: Revenue below estimates as macro uncertainty persists, profit exceeds expectations    The layoffs at TCS have, in fact, ignited larger conversations on whether or not the IT industry itself may be headed for a major reset, amid turbulence from global macro uncertainties, impact of US' crushing tariffs on overall outsourcing sentiments, and the AI-led disruptions.    As it is, India's top IT services companies have delivered single-digit revenue growth in Q1 FY26, capping off a somewhat-sobering June quarter as macroeconomic instability and geopolitical tensions have weighed on global tech demand and delayed client decision-making.

        "Title": "Cautious market sentiment persists: SBI Securities\u2019 Sudeep Shah on FII moves for coming week, bullish on 5 stocks",
        "Date": "2025-04-13",
        "Description": "Considering the current chart structure, Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities recommends adopting a cautious stance and stock-specific approach.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, FIIs continue to adopt a cautious stance amid ongoing global uncertainty.    The FII long-short ratio stands at just 25.36%, indicating that 74.64% of their index futures positions remain on the short side. This suggests FIIs are still largely hedged or positioned for the downside, he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.    The Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities believes that until there is clarity on global trade tensions and bond yields stabilize, FIIs are likely to remain defensive, and their current positioning hints at continued caution going into next week.    Considering the current chart structure, he recommends adopting a cautious stance on the market and a stock-specific approach for the coming week.    Do you believe the momentum can be sustained in the coming week, taking the Nifty 50 decisively above 23,000?    The past week (ended April 11) turned out to be one of the most volatile in recent memory, with heightened turbulence sweeping across all major asset classes. This wave of volatility was triggered after US President Donald Trump announced a fresh round of tariffs, reigniting concerns over global trade tensions. In response, the US 10-year bond yield surged by over 10%, which was its steepest weekly gain since April 2022. Gold prices skyrocketed above the $3,200 per troy ounce mark for the first time, reflecting a flight to safety. Meanwhile, Brent crude slipped more than 4%, signaling demand worries, and the US Dollar Index dropped below the 99.50 level \u2014 a low not seen since April 2022. Equity markets were not spared either, as all major indices experienced sharp swings amid the unfolding macro uncertainty.    Our benchmark index, Nifty, was no exception, experiencing heightened volatility throughout the week. Each trading session opened with either a significant gap-up or a gap-down, reflecting the jittery sentiment prevailing in the market. The volatility index, India VIX, spiked over 45% during the week, underlining the surge in uncertainty and investor nervousness.    Interestingly, on Monday, after hitting a low of 21,743, the Nifty staged a sharp rebound of more than 1,000 points and ended the week by forming a Bullish Belt Hold-like candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. However, despite this sharp pullback, the index failed to close above its 20-day EMA. Momentum indicators and oscillators are currently suggesting a lack of clear directional bias, pointing toward a possible phase of consolidation.    Considering the current chart structure, we recommend adopting a cautious stance and stock-specific approach. Until the index confirms sustained strength above key moving averages, it would be prudent to avoid aggressive positions and focus on risk management. Regarding crucial levels, the zone of 22,600-22,550 will act as immediate support for the index, while, on the upside, the 50-day EMA zone of 23,000-23,050 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 23,050 will lead to an extension of the pullback rally up to the level of 23,300, followed by the 23,500 level.    How are the FIIs positioning themselves for the next week, considering that tariff-led uncertainty is unlikely to end soon?    FIIs continue to adopt a cautious stance amid ongoing global uncertainty. In the cash segment, they have been net sellers to the tune of Rs 34,641.79 crore month-to-date, reflecting a clear risk-off sentiment. The recent surge in US 10-year bond yields are further discouraging flows into emerging markets like India.    In the derivatives market, the FII long-short ratio stands at just 25.36%, indicating that 74.64% of their index futures positions remain on the short side. This suggests they are still largely hedged or positioned for the downside.    Hence, we believe that until there is clarity on global trade tensions and bond yields stabilize, FIIs are likely to remain defensive, and their current positioning hints at continued caution going into next week.    Do you think the Bank Nifty looks much better than the Nifty 50 on the charts?    Bank Nifty is currently showing strong relative outperformance compared to the frontline indices. While Nifty breached its previous swing low of 21,965 last week, Bank Nifty held firm, marking a higher low at 49,156\u2014well above its earlier swing low of 47,703. This signals underlying strength in the banking index.    On Monday, it took support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior rally (47,703\u201352,064), and has since rebounded over 1,800 points. Importantly, the index continues to trade above both its short and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the bullish undertone.    The current chart structure suggests that Bank Nifty is well-positioned to outperform in the near term. Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 51,500-51,600 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 51,600 will lead to a sharp upside rally up to the level of 52,500, followed by the 53,100 level in the near term. On the downside, the 20-day EMA zone of 50,500-50,400 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    What are your top two picks for next week?    Power Grid Corporation of India    Power Grid has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices for the last couple of trading sessions. Also, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. The daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) stays in bullish territory as it is quoting above its zero line and signal line. The MACD histogram is suggesting a pickup in upside momentum.    The trend strength indicator, the Average Directional Index (ADX), is at 31.50, which indicates robust strength. The +DI is much above the -DI. This structure is indicative of the bullish strength in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the zone of Rs 305-300 level with a stop-loss of Rs 293 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 325 in the short term.    Poonawalla Fincorp    Poonawalla Fincorp surged above its recent swing high on Friday. Currently, it is trading above their crucial moving averages. The 20 and 50-day EMA is in rising mode, which is a bullish sign. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI is in a super bullish zone as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating in the zone of Rs 368-364 level with a stop-loss of Rs 355 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 390 in the short term.    Are you super bullish on PI Industries, given it is forming a robust bullish candle on the weekly charts, and Dixon Technologies, which is on the verge of a trendline breakout on the daily charts?    PI Industries    Yes, we are bullish on PI Industries as it has given a downward-sloping trendline breakout on a daily chart. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, the stock has surged above its 100-day EMA level for the first time since November 2024. The momentum indicators also suggest strong bullish momentum. The daily RSI is in a bullish zone, and it is in a rising trajectory. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its upward journey and test the level of Rs 4,000 in the short term. On the downside, the zone of Rs 3,480-3,470 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    Dixon Technologies    Dixon is on the verge of breaking out above a downward-sloping trendline on the daily chart. What\u2019s noteworthy is the strong volume witnessed on Friday, even before the actual breakout occurred. This suggests early accumulation by smart investors, indicating growing confidence in the stock's potential upside. Going ahead, the zone of Rs 14,400-14,500 will act as a crucial hurdle for the stock as a downward sloping trendline and 100-day EMA is placed in that region. Any sustainable move above the level of Rs 14,500 will lead to a sharp upside rally in the stock.    Is it the right time to add exposure to PNB Housing Finance, and is CG Power &amp;amp; Industrial Solutions done with its correction?    It is the right time to add exposure to PNB Housing but not to CG Power. The stock of PNB Housing has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices since the last couple of trading sessions. It is marking the sequence of gradual higher tops and higher bottoms. Also, it is trading above its crucial moving averages. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI is in a super bullish zone as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its upward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.    At the same time, the stock of CG Power is still in a downtrend as it is quoting below its short and long-term moving averages. Hence, we recommend avoiding it for now.

        "Description": "However, Reliance expects oil demand to rise despite growing EV penetration, driven by strong economic growth, China stimulus measures and possible easing of geopolitical tensions",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) warned in its annual report that continuing geopolitical and tariff-related uncertainties could disrupt trade flows and the demand-supply balance in its oil-to-chemicals business.    The company said crude prices will remain volatile amid evolving sanctions, changing tariff regimes and output decisions by OPEC and non-OPEC members. However, oil demand is likely to maintain growth despite growing electric vehicle (EV) adoption, amid strong economic growth, China stimulus measures and possible easing of geopolitical tensions.    In its 2025 oil outlook, RIL said the ramp-up of new refineries may lead to weaker product cracks. &quot;However, expected closures could create upside potential for refining margins. Fuel demand in India is expected to remain healthy with increasing economic activity,&quot; the company said.    &quot;Demand for downstream chemical products in India is expected to grow ahead of the GDP growth rate, driven by demand from infrastructure, packaging, automobiles and agriculture,&quot; RIL added.    RIL said it maintains a robust liquidity management framework to &quot;ensure financial flexibility and resilience in all market conditions&quot;. The company said it leveraged a diverse funding strategy and efficiently managed working capital. &quot;RIL\u2019s surplus funds were deployed in stable yield instruments, insulated from unfavourable market movements to ensure immediate access to liquidity,&quot; it said.    RIL said that despite a volatile environment, it successfully executed a multi-currency, multi-instrument financing strategy, achieving an optimal capital structure at competitive costs. The proceeds were primarily utilised to fund green capital expenditures and to refinance upcoming debt maturities, it said.    RIL said it remains on track to become net carbon zero by 2035 and is progressing rapidly to set up a 30 GWh modular battery gigafactory for cells, packs, containerised BESS (battery energy storage system), and the backward integration into battery materials.

While the orderbook (OB) was healthy at INR 100.6bn as of Jun\u201925 (book-to-bill of 0.8), order inflow (OI) fell 12% YoY. The decline was due to dip in large orders, while base orders were up 5% YoY. ABB attributed the dip to sluggish domestic demand as private capex was delayed due to macro uncertainties. ABB also reported margin contraction in Q2, partly due to lower gross margin (higher import content), a one-off cost, forex losses, and adverse revenue mix. EBITDA margin was down ~610bps YoY, dragging the EBITDA/PAT to INR 4.1bn/ 3.5bn (-24%/-20% YoY).  Outlook  We expect near-term outlook to be slightly negative in terms of both OI and profitability; green shoots in OI especially large orders, is a key monitorable.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmarks corrected after a day of rally, with the Nifty 50 declining by a third of a percent on August 5, as the market breadth was skewed in favour of bears. About 1,608 shares were under pressure compared to 1,069 shares that advanced on the NSE. The consolidation with a negative bias is expected to persist in the upcoming sessions. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 240.65        After a decline from higher levels, Bank of Baroda has rebounded from its support zone on the daily charts. Moreover, there was a sloping trendline breakout along with decent volume activity. The stock is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels. The upward movement in the stock suggests a new leg of the bullish trend in the near term. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 230, the bullish momentum is likely to continue.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 260    Stop-Loss: Rs 230    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 614.75        On the daily timeframe, ICICI Prudential Life had been in a downtrend. It is now in oversold territory and within its demand area. The texture of the chart formation and technical indicators such as the RSI indicate that the stock is very likely to rebound for a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 590 could be the trend-deciding level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, we can expect a further uptrend towards Rs 660.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 660    Stop-Loss: Rs 590    Tata Consumer Products | CMP: Rs 1,064.8        After the remarkable uptrend of the last few weeks, Tata Consumer Products witnessed a short-term correction from higher levels. However, on the weekly charts, the stock is near an important retracement zone. The chart formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For traders, Rs 1,020 would be the key support level to watch. Above this level, the uptrend could continue towards Rs 1,140.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,140    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    BLS International Services | CMP: Rs 399.55        On the daily timeframe, BLS International Services has been consolidating in a range between Rs 351\u2013392 since June 2025. In the previous session, the stock managed to break out of the upper end of the range, closing near Rs 399. Over the past six trading sessions, the stock has held above the previous candle\u2019s low on a closing basis, which is a positive sign.    After the sharp rise, buying on dips appears to be a wiser strategy for riding the ongoing trend with better risk management. After the breakout, we can expect good momentum on the upside in the upcoming sessions. One can use dips as a buying opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 420, Rs 438    Stop-Loss: Rs 385    Hero MotoCorp | CMP: 4,546.8        On the daily chart, Hero MotoCorp has been trading within a broader range of Rs 4,150 to Rs 4,490 since May 2025. Since the start of this week, the auto sector has outperformed other sectors, with Hero MotoCorp emerging as one of its key contributors, which is a strong bullish sign. The stock has already broken out of the mentioned range, which is again a positive sign.    Moreover, Bollinger Bands have started to expand, indicating increased volatility, with prices closing above the upper bands, which can further boost positive momentum in the stock. Along with this, the MACD has just witnessed a bullish crossover, providing double confirmation for our stance. The current trend for Hero MotoCorp has shifted in favour of the bulls. One should use dips as a buying opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,700, Rs 4815    Stop-Loss: Rs 4,330    Godawari Power and Ispat | CMP: Rs 200        In the previous session, despite major indices falling, Godawari Power and Ispat managed to gain 1.8%, indicating that bulls are getting active in the stock. Prices have been respecting their upward-sloping trendline since March 2025. Additionally, the stock has managed to retrace 50% of its fall that began in December 2024.

        "Content": "Motilal Oswal's research report on ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank\u2019s results epitomize the saying, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going.\u201d Over the past few years, irrespective of the sectoral challenges such as unsecured asset quality issues, systemic growth moderation, liability accretion or NIM headwinds, the bank has been able to deliver a stellar performance, beating Street expectations. During 1QFY26, the controlled NIM decline of 7bp (half of our estimate) was another solid beat in that series, compared to a double-digit contraction reported by many peers. The bank continues to focus on superior risk-adjusted returns, underpinned by prudent underwriting and strong credit discipline. 1Q PAT grew 15.5% YoY to INR127.6b (6% beat), aided by resilient margins, controlled opex and healthy treasury gains. NII rose 11% YoY/2% QoQ to INR216.3b (3% beat). NIM contracted by a marginal 7bp QoQ to 4.34%. Treasury gains stood at INR12.4b vs. INR2.4b in 4QFY25.    Outlook  We maintain our earnings estimates and expect FY27E RoA/RoE at 2.3%/17.3%. ICICIBC remains our preferred BUY in the sector with a revised TP of INR1,670 (2.7x FY27E ABV).

        "Description": "Brokerages largely reiterated their bullishness on IT services giant Infosys, believing that the tech player is best positioned among its large-cap peers. ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Information and technology major Infosys Ltd reported its earnings show for the June quarter, leading to a slew of brokerages reiterating their bullishness on the IT services giant as its results came ahead of expectations.    Infosys reported an 8.7 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,921 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, beating Street expectations. Revenue for the fiscal first quarter grew 7.5 percent to Rs 42,279 crore.    Infosys said it expects revenue growth of 1-3 percent in constant currency terms for FY26, revised up from 0-3 percent earlier. The firm maintained its operating margin guidance at 20-22 percent.    However, brokerages noted that including inorganic contribution (0.4 percent), the revenue guidance actually translates into a cut at the top end of the guidance \u2013 attributed to continued macro uncertainty by the management.    As a result of the macro uncertainty, the manufacturing and retail verticals were the most impacted. There are some opportunities in Europe, which are largely driven by consolidation and outsourcing.    At 10.15 a.m., shares were trading in the red, lower by 1 percent at Rs 1,557.5 on the NSE.    Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of Infosys?    Domestic brokerage Nuvama Institutional Equities said, &quot;Infosys reported solid growth \u2013 both in magnitude and quality (lower third-party revenue). The guidance upgrade was a tad soft \u2013 but  understandably so, given the overall macro uncertainty.&quot; The brokerage maintained its 'buy' call, with an increased price target of Rs 1,850 per share, up from Rs 1,700 earlier.    International brokerage Morgan Stanley noted that Infosys' result for the quarter was more balanced, when compared to peers. The brokerage said that Infosys is likely to deliver the strongest EBIT growth within the large-cap IT universe in the current fiscal year. It maintained its 'overweight' call, with a price target of Rs 1,700 apiece.    CLSA said that the IT giant's earnings growth was better than estimates, and &quot;ticked all the right boxes.&quot; The broking house reiterated its outperform call, with a price target of Rs 1,861 per share. Bernstein concurred, stating that Infosys delivered a solid quarter, beating revenue and order book estimates. The brokerage also kept its 'outperform' call intact.    On the other hand, Motilal Oswal kept its 'neutral' call. The brokerage said that despite the strong Q1, Infosys continues to see a wait-and-watch posture among clients, with no material improvement  in discretionary budgets or decision cycles. Tariff uncertainties and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on sentiment. &quot;Management stated that the macro environment remains unchanged vs. 4Q, which was a key reason for the cautious stance on guidance,&quot; added the broking house.

        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "Banking shares extended gains for a fifth session to push the Bank Nifty higher by a percent at around 49,700 on March 19, with the recent rebound swiftly gathering steam to partially recover the sharp losses seen in the index since December 2024, and chartist sounding confident of further momentum.    Axis Securities shared a bullish outlook for Nifty Bank as well as Nifty 50 index. &quot;The trend-deciding level of the day is 49,115. If Bank Nifty trades above this level, it may rally up to 49,600-49,886-50,371 levels. However, if it trades below 49,115 levels, we may witness profit booking in the market, and the index may correct up to 48,829-48,344-48,058 levels,&quot; it said in its latest note.    Angel One said the rally seen in bank stocks on March 18 smashed the critical 48,800-48,900 resistance zone for Bank Nifty. This has &quot;convincingly shifted the momentum in favour of the bulls&quot;. They expect the index to further push towards higher levels.    AU Small Finance Bank was the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 4 percent on strong buying after touching a 52-week low of Rs 478 on March 18.    Shares of Federal Bank and Punjab National Bank (PNB) followed, rising around 2 percent each. IndusInd Bank shares meanwhile rose around 1.8 percent. The stock has now pared some gains after jumping 3 percent earlier in the day. The positive momentum in the bank's stock was fueled after IndusInd International Holdings (IIHL) Chairman Ashok Hinduja\u2019s assurance to support the lender\u2019s capital requirement, adding that it is an opportune time to increase stake in IndusInd Bank.    Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda shares rose over a percent. Heavyweights State Bank of India (SBI) and Axis Bank were also trading over 1 percent higher at Rs 746 apiece and Rs 1,057 apiece respectively. Another heavyweight HDFC Bank saw its share price rise nearly 1 percent to trade at Rs 1,748 apiece. IDFC First Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were meanwhile trading with marginal gains.

        "Author": "Broker Research",
        "Content": "Emkay Global Financial's research report on ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank has noted a superlative performance yet again, with 5% PAT beat at Rs126bn (up 18% YoY; historically superior RoA of ~2.5%), healthy credit growth at 13% YoY, and a sharp 16bps QoQ margin uptick to 4.4%. Overall asset quality improved, with GNPA ratio down by 29bps QoQ to more than a decadal low of 1.7%. The bank continues to hold healthy specific/contingent provision buffer, which we believe should protect its P&amp;amp;L from initial assetquality hiccups, if any. Notwithstanding the expected near-term margin pressure across the sector following the RBI\u2019s consecutive rate-cuts, we believe ICICIB is well positioned to deliver over 2% RoA on the back of better cost management/lower LLP. This, coupled with management credibility vs peers and capital/provision buffers, grants us confidence on the stock.  Outlook  We hence continue to favor ICICIB while upping its TP by ~10% to Rs 1,600, based on 2.6x FY27E ABV (deserving premium over HDFCB@2.5x) and subs at Rs260/sh.

        "Content": "The Nifty IT index tumbled almost two percent in trade, dragged by midcap IT services players Persistent Systems Ltd and Coforge Ltd, on Thursday, July 24.    At 10.15 a.m., the Nifty IT index was down two percent or 733 points at 36,218. All index constituents, barring Oracle Financial Services Software, were trading in the red.    Constituents Persistent Systems and Coforge were trading at Rs 5,099 and Rs 1,688 respectively, both lower by nine percent. The fall in the shares of the firms dragged the index by 128 points, respectively. Further, index heavyweight Infosys was down one percent, but due to its weightage of 39.3 percent in the Nifty IT index, it dragged the index by 150 points.    Persistent Systems' revenue for the quarter grew 3.9 percent or 3.3 percent in constant currency terms to $389.7 million. The revenue growth was led by the BFSI arm, (up 9 percent QoQ) and Software, Hi-Tech &amp;amp; Emerging Industries (up 3.6 percent), while Healthcare &amp;amp; Lifesciences (down 1.9 percent) saw a decline, primarily due to planned offshore shift at some of the large customers.    Coforge posted an 8 percent growth in revenue in constant currency terms for the June quarter. The performance also sharply contrasted with Persistent Systems and LTIMindtree, which reported CC growth of 3.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.    Infosys reported an 8.7 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 6,921 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, beating Street expectations. Revenue for the fiscal first quarter grew 7.5 percent to Rs 42,279 crore. Infosys said it expects revenue growth of 1-3 percent in constant currency terms for FY26, revised up from 0-3 percent earlier. The firm maintained its operating margin guidance at 20-22 percent.    All the IT players stated that the elevated macro and geopolitical uncertainty may cause a near-term blip, as clients adopt a more cautious stance.    In the midcap space, Nomura said it prefers Coforge to Persistent Systems, while all brokerages were bullish on Infosys, believing the IT services giant would outperform its largecap peers in the current financial year.

        "Content": "Adani group\u2019s renewable energy arm Adani Green Energy Ltd is in advanced talks with a State Bank of India-led consortium to raise Rs 8,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore to repay foreign currency loans worth $1.1 billion which are due in March, sources told Moneycontrol .    The $1.1 billion is a construction finance facility which was raised by Adani Green from a group of foreign banks for 1,390 megawatts (MW) hybrid solar and wind projects in Rajasthan.    \u201cTalks with the PSU bank consortium are in the final stages. The existing foreign currency construction finance loans will be replaced with 18\u201320-year long project debt from the domestic lender consortium,\u201d one of the sources said.    The domestic refinancing comes after Adani Green had to scrap a $600-million dollar bond offering in November following a US Department of Justice (DoJ) indictment over alleged bribes paid to Indian state officials to get power supply contracts.    In an exchange filing in November, Adani Green told shareholders that considering the DoJ criminal indictment against Gautam Adani, Sagar Adani and Vineet Adani, the company\u2019s subsidiaries decided not to proceed with the US dollar-denominated bond offerings.    In an analyst call on January 24, Adani Green said the company is seeing interest from all the domestic lenders even for new projects.    \u201cOn the refinancing of the project, which is due in the end of this quarter, we are in a very advanced stage of discussion with one of the domestic lenders, and we should be able to announce its completion in the next few weeks,\u201d Adani Green Energy CEO Amit Singh told analysts.    \u201cI think the domestic lenders are more excited to work with us. They will have more opportunity. They're looking to work with us.\u201d    Emails sent to Adani Group and SBI did not elicit a response till the time of publication.    Rajasthan renewable assets    The assets whose foreign currency loans are to be refinanced are housed under three entities titled \u2014 Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer One Ltd, Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Two Ltd and Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Four Ltd.    These hybrid solar and wind energy assets were commissioned between 2022 and 2023. They have a solar and wind mix of 65 percent and 35 percent.    The entities have 25-year power purchase agreements with Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) and Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd.    Around 690 MW of the energy generation capacity is contracted with SECI and the remaining 700 MW will be be supplied to Adani Electricity.    Adani Green Energy has an operating capacity of around 10 gigawatts (GW) with another five gigawatts expected to get operational by October. The renewable energy company is aiming to build a capacity of 45-50 GW by financial year FY28.",

        "Content": "HDFC Bank will consider a bonus issue of shares at its board meeting on July 19, India's largest private lender said on July 16. If approved, this would be the first such move by the Mumbai-based bank.    Along with the bonus issue of shares, HDFC Bank will also consider a special interim dividend for its shareholders for the ongoing financial year 2026, the lender said in its exchange filing. The record date set to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the prospective bonus shares and special dividend is yet to be announced.    After its board meeting, the private lender will announce its results for the first quarter of the financial year 2026.    The earlier corporate action taken by the company apart from dividend announcement included stock splits in 2019 and 2011. The shares of the private lender have rallied over 21 percent in the past six months, and nearly 4 percent in the past one month.    HDFC Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains at Rs 2,005 apiece in the morning. The stock has gained over 12 percent in 2025 so far.

        "Content": "The shares of FMCG companies recorded strong losses on May 27, as investors resorted to profit booking after significant rally. The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty FMCG index down over 1.3 percent to emerge as the top sectoral loser.    ITC shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 434.70 apiece, while United Breweries shares plunged 1.4 percent. Heavyweight Hindustan Unilever (HUL) declined nearly 0.5 percent to trade at Rs 2,383 apiece.    Godrej Consumer Products, Britannia Industries, Patanjali Foods and Tata Consumer Products shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.    Bucking the trend, Varun Beverages, Dabur India, Marico, Colgate Palmolive and Nestle shares closed in the green, recording marginal gains for their investors.    Notably, the FMCG stocks have seen significant volatility recently. The index surged nearly 2,000 points (over 2.6 percent) in the past two sessions. This comes as monsoon hit several parts of the country, arriving nearly eight days ahead of schedule, the earliest in 16 years. This is likely to boost consumption, and as a result gave a boost to FMCG stocks.    &quot;Fertilizer, Agrochemical, FMCG, Auto and rural finance sectors would remain in focus due to the early onset of the monsoon and forecasts of above-average rainfall,&quot; said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.    The government expects above normal monsoon conditions to provide a significant boost to consumption and productivity in the upcoming financial year, senior government sources said on May 23. &quot;With good or above-normal monsoon, productivity and consumption will grow. Funds in consumption-related sectors are at a high. All these add up, showing the economy is fine,&quot; a government source told Moneycontrol.    The earlier rise in the share prices was also buoyed by positive earnings. ITC on May 22 had reported a net profit Rs 19,562 crore for the fourth quarter of FY25. This however included a one-time exceptional item of Rs 15,179 crore from discontinued operations. It also reported revenue from operations at Rs 18,494 crore, higher than the Rs 17,371 crore revenue estimated on an average by nine brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.    The shares strongly surged over the two days. However, the latest fall in the share prices may come as investors resort to profit booking ay elevated prices.

        "Content": "Equity benchmark indices corrected 0.3 percent on May 28, continuing their downward journey for another session amid rangebound trading. Market breadth was equal, with 1,290 shares advancing against 1,282 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to remain directionless in the upcoming sessions until it decisively breaks the trading range of May 15. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan    Bank of India | CMP: Rs 119.94        Bank of India has broken out of a triangle pattern, suggesting the start of a fresh leg of upmove. The daily momentum indicator has given a positive crossover, which is a buy signal. The breakout has been accompanied by above-average volume.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 125, Rs 129    Stop-Loss: Rs 116    Adani Energy Solutions | CMP: Rs 869        Adani Energy Solutions has broken down from a bearish flag pattern on the downside, indicating the start of a fresh leg of downmove. The daily momentum indicator has given a positive crossover, which is a sell signal.    Strategy: Sell    Target: Rs 834    Stop-Loss: Rs 882    Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.    RailTel Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 401.45        A few days of consolidation ended with a sharp spike in price, indicating a rise in optimistic sentiment as investors grow confident about the stock's future prospects. The recent rally has lifted the stock above its 200-DMA, signaling a medium-term bullish trend. Additionally, RailTel Corporation has resumed its uptrend after taking support at the falling trendline. In the short term, the trend appears strong, with the potential to reach Rs 440. Support is placed at Rs 384, below which the momentum may weaken. Buy the stock above Rs 405.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 440    Stop-Loss: Rs 384    Life Insurance Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 942        Life Insurance Corporation has given a strong breakout from recent consolidation, clearly indicating rising bullish momentum. It has closed above the 200-DMA for the first time since October last year, signaling a potential trend reversal. Short-term strength is likely to remain intact as long as the stock holds above Rs 924. A move above Rs 950 would further strengthen the trend and could drive the stock toward Rs 1,000 or even higher. Buy the stock above Rs 950.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 924    Sudeep Shah, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities    Canara Bank | CMP: Rs 110.94        Nifty PSU Bank was the top gainer on Wednesday and has been outperforming the frontline indices over the last couple of trading sessions. The stock of Canara Bank has staged a breakout from an 8-day consolidation pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by a noticeable uptick in volumes\u2014indicating strong market participation. The stock is currently trading above its short- and long-term moving averages, both of which are trending higher, reaffirming the bullish setup. Momentum indicators further support this strength.    The daily RSI remains in bullish territory and continues to trend upwards, while the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is comfortably placed above both the zero line and the signal line, confirming a bullish momentum bias. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 111\u2013110, with a stop-loss of Rs 107. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 120 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 120    Stop-Loss: Rs 107    Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals | CMP: Rs 148.83        Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has broken out above a downward-sloping trendline on the daily timeframe, backed by exceptional volume action. On the breakout day, volumes surged to 160.32 lakh shares, significantly exceeding the 50-day average of 60.67 lakh\u2014indicating robust buying interest from both institutional and retail investors.    Most noteworthy, the stock has moved above its 200-day EMA for the first time since September 2024, a key technical milestone. Additionally, the RSI recently took support at the 60 level and rebounded sharply, indicating a shift into the \u2018super bullish\u2019 zone, as per RSI range-shift theory. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 149\u2013148, with a stop-loss of Rs 142. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 163 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 163    Stop-Loss: Rs 142    Central Depository Services | CMP: 1,519.3        Central Depository Services (CDSL) has witnessed a strong consolidation breakout on the daily chart, supported by healthy volume expansion. The technical setup remains robust, with the stock trading above all key moving averages and showing solid momentum across indicators. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish terrain and continues to rise. MACD remains positive and well above the signal and zero lines, while the ADX\u2014an indicator of trend strength\u2014has moved above the 25 level and is gaining traction, confirming trend acceleration. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,520\u20131,510, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,465. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,610 in the short term.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Nestle  Nestle\u2019s Q4FY25 operational performance was subdued with revenue growth of 4% YoY on a high base of 9% and ~100 bps margin contraction primarily due to inflationary pressures in key raw materials such as coffee, edible oil and palm oil. During the quarter, the performance was led by double-digit growth in the Beverages and Confectionery categories, largely driven by pricing actions. This was partially offset by muted performance in the Prepared Dishes and Milk Nutrition segments, impacted by high competition and weak consumer demand, respectively. Nestle announced the appointment of Manish Tiwary as MD for a fiveyear term starting April 1, 2025. Under Suresh Narayanan tenure (2015-2025), Nestle achieved significant outperformance compared to peers through consistent product innovation and distribution expansion in the rural markets.  Outlook  We marginally tweaked our estimates, modelling revenue / EBITDA / PAT CAGR of 11% / 14% / 17% over FY25-26E. Maintain HOLD with a DCF-based revised target price of INR 2,350 (vs INR 2,300).

On June 16, Moneycontrol was the first to report that HDB Financial Services was likely to launch its IPO by end of June, targetting a post-money valuation of around $7.2 billion (around Rs 62,000 crore) at the higher end of the price band. The report had specified June 24 and June 25-27 as the proposed timelines for the anchor book and public subscription.    The HDB Financial Services IPO comprises a fresh issue of Rs 2,500 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 10,000 crore by parent HDFC Bank, which holds 94.3 per cent stake. The firm had filed it's draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) for the IPO in October 2024.    On September 7, Moneycontrol was the first to report that HDB Financial Services had engaged at least 4 investment banks and kicked off the mega IPO process.    Earlier, on July 20, 2024, the board of directors of HDFC Bank provided an in-principle approval to initiate the process of listing of HDB Financial Services and formed a committee of directors to undertake various steps in this regard.    The listing is a mandatory requirement with HDB Financial Services being an &quot;Upper Layer&quot; NBFC pursuant to the circular issued by the RBI in October 2022. As per the RBI, all &quot;Upper Layer&quot; NBFC's are required to list within three years of being notified, i.e., September 2025.    According to the DRHP, the HDB Financial IPO syndicate is a large one of 12 investment banks including JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities, Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Securities, Nomura, IIFL Securities, Morgan Stanley, Nuvama, Motilal Oswal and UBS. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is the company counsel.

Merchant realisation in Q1 declined to INR 6.5/kWh (vs. INR 7.6/kWh YoY). As a result, Adani Power (APL) reported Q1 with EBITDA and PAT at INR 57bn (-8%) and 33bn (-16%), respectively. Its dependence on merchant is currently at 22% which could decline in next few years. In Q1, it signed a PPA for 1.6GW at an attractive tariff, taking its total under construction (UC) capacity with PPA to ~5GW (out of 12.5GW). State discoms are in the process of floating PPAs. As a result, we expect new tenders from state discoms to improve the outlook of the upcoming untied capacity. In Q1, it had also placed an additional 4.8GW turbine order, signalling its plans for new capacity addition beyond 31GW. Retain BUY with revised TP of INR 669 (earlier INR 610).  Outlook  Maintain BUY with revised TP of INR 669 (earlier INR 610) as we roll forward to FY28E earnings. We believe new PPAs are being signed at attractive rates.

Buffer provisions stood at 82bps vs 96bps for ICICIB. As LDR has declined to 95% from 103.5% a year ago, focus is back on shoring up loan growth/CASA. Targeted medium term LDR is 87-90%.

        "Content": "Leading brokerage UBS has revised its ratings on two major PSU banks, upgrading State Bank of India to \u2018Neutral\u2019 from \u2018Sell\u2019 and Bank of Baroda to \u2018Buy\u2019 from \u2018Neutral\u2019, citing stabilizing metrics and more attractive valuations behind the upgrades.    Read More: LIVE Updates and News    UBS said the recent policy developments and a stronger liquidity position are promising signs for SBI. The stock has seen a modest gain of around a percent in the past year compared to Bank Nifty\u2019s 8% rise.    The largest PSU lender is expected to benefit from tax rebate in the budget and the likely rollout of the Eighth Pay Commission recommendation. UBS said SBI\u2019s liquidity has improved, reporting a surplus of about Rs 8 lakh crore in March, in contrast to a peak deficit of Rs 3.3 lakh crore earlier. UBS also raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for SBI by 3-5 percent, however, it remains cautious due to SBI\u2019s relatively low Common Equity Tier I (CET I) ratio of about 11% compared to peers like HDFC Bank (17.5 percent) and ICICI Bank (16 percent).    UBS said while there are positives, the balanced risk-reward profile justifies the \u2018Neutral\u2019 stance, with a revised price target of Rs 840 per share, up from the previous Rs 760.    UBS upgraded Bank of Baroda to \u2018Buy\u2019, pointing to a stabilizing outlook and favourable valuations. Although BoB has faced challenges like weak NII growth and sluggish loan expansion, UBS sees reasons for optimism. Loan growth, which has remained below 12% YoY, is expected to pick up pace, supported by a healthier mix of retail loans and stable corporate asset quality.    Additionally, BoB's liquidity ratios\u2014such as a strong LCR of around 130% and an LDR of about 83%\u2014are likely to support future loan growth, UBS said. The note said that recent correction of around 16% in BoB's stock price makes it attractively valued, trading at 0.8x Sept FY26e Price to Book Value (P/BV). The brokerage has set a revised price target of Rs 290 per share, up from Rs 270.    The recalibrated outlook on SBI and BoB reflects a nuanced view by UBS of the public sector banking space, highlighting both challenges and potential catalysts for growth.

        "Content": "The shares of FMCG companies recorded notable losses on June 12, pushing the Nifty FMCG index down nearly 1.3 percent to hover around 55,110 in the afternoon. The index has now extended losses for the second consecutive day, after a strong five-day rally.    Dabur shares were the top loser on the index, dropping nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 473 apiece.

Marico and ITC shares fell over 1 percent, while Britannia Industries, Colgate Palmolive, United Spirits, Patanjali Foods and United Breweries shares were trading in the red with marginal losses.

Sensex plunged 713 points to hover around 81,773, while Nifty 50 was down nearly 0.9 percent to stand at 24,919.    Hardik Matalia, Derivative analyst at Choice Broking, called the fall in FMCG stocks a result of mild profit booking and sectoral rotation. \u201cGiven the prevailing global uncertainties and event-driven risks, traders are advised to maintain a disciplined approach with strict risk management.

        "Description": "HDFC Bank Opens Special Window for Physical Share Transfer Re-lodgement",
        "Author": "Alpha Desk",
        "Content": "  HDFC Bank Limited has announced the opening of a special six-month window for the re-lodgement of transfer requests for physical shares. This initiative, effective from July 7, 2025, to January 6, 2026, aims to facilitate investors whose transfer deeds, lodged prior to April 1, 2019, were previously rejected, returned, or not attended to due to various deficiencies in documents, process, or other reasons. This move is in compliance with SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-POD/P/CIR/2025/97 dated July 2, 2025, providing a crucial opportunity for shareholders to regularize their physical shareholdings.    Special Window for Physical Share Transfer Re-lodgement      Particulars  Details          Company  HDFC Bank Limited      Action Type  Special Window for Re-lodgement of Physical Share Transfer Requests      Window Start Date  July 7, 2025      Window End Date  January 6, 2026      Duration  Six months      Applicability  Transfer deeds lodged prior to April 1, 2019, which were rejected, returned, or unattended due to deficiencies.      Previous Missed Deadline  March 31, 2021      Regulatory Basis  SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-POD/P/CIR/2025/97 dated July 2, 2025      Submission Agent  Datamatics Business Solutions Limited      Submission Address  Plot Nos. A 16 &amp;amp; 17, Part B Cross Lane, MIDC, Andheri East, Mumbai 400093        Action Details  The special window has been opened specifically to address a long-standing issue for a segment of investors holding physical shares. Many transfer requests for physical shares, particularly those lodged before April 1, 2019, faced rejection or remained unprocessed due to various reasons, including incomplete documentation, procedural errors, or other discrepancies. This new six-month period, from July 7, 2025, to January 6, 2026, provides a dedicated channel for these shareholders to resubmit their transfer requests. The initiative underscores HDFC Bank's commitment to facilitating shareholder convenience and ensuring compliance with regulatory directives aimed at streamlining the share transfer process.  Process and Timeline  Shareholders wishing to utilize this special window must submit their necessary documents to the Bank's Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA), Datamatics Business Solutions Limited. The RTA's office is located at Plot Nos. A 16 &amp;amp; 17, Part B Cross Lane, MIDC, Andheri East, Mumbai 400093. It is crucial for investors to ensure that all required documents are furnished accurately and completely to avoid further delays. This facility is particularly beneficial for those investors who missed the earlier deadline of March 31, 2021, for similar re-lodgement opportunities. The six-month duration provides ample time for eligible shareholders to gather and submit their paperwork, ensuring that their physical share transfer issues can finally be resolved. The bank encourages all affected investors to take full advantage of this limited-time opportunity.  Shareholder Impact  This special window is a significant positive development for shareholders who have been grappling with unresolved physical share transfer issues. For many years, the Indian securities market has been transitioning towards a fully dematerialized environment, making physical share transfers increasingly challenging. This initiative by HDFC Bank, in line with SEBI's guidelines, offers a lifeline to those whose transfer requests were previously stuck. By successfully re-lodging and processing these transfers, shareholders will gain clear title to their shares, which can then be dematerialized. Dematerialization enhances liquidity, reduces the risk of theft or loss of physical certificates, and simplifies future transactions such as buying, selling, or pledging shares. It also ensures that shareholders receive corporate benefits like dividends and bonus shares directly and efficiently. This move is expected to bring relief and clarity to a segment of the investor base that has faced difficulties in managing their physical shareholdings.  Regulatory Context  The opening of this special window is a direct consequence of SEBI's ongoing efforts to enhance investor protection and streamline the securities market. SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-POD/P/CIR/2025/97, dated July 2, 2025, reflects the regulator's commitment to addressing legacy issues related to physical shares. Historically, SEBI has mandated the dematerialization of shares for various corporate actions and has set deadlines for physical share transfers. This specific circular and the subsequent action by HDFC Bank provide a final opportunity for investors to comply with these regulations and transition their holdings into the electronic format. Such regulatory interventions are vital for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the capital markets, ensuring that all shareholders, regardless of their holding format, can participate seamlessly and securely.

        "Content": "FMCG major Hindustan Unilever sees stable demand trends in the coming quarters with expectations of a sequential improvement in gross margins, backed by gradual recovery in the urban demand, good monsoon and improving macros, chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.    The country's biggest packaged goods maker expects quarterly EBITDA margins to  be at 22 percent to 23 percent, down from earlier range of 23 percent to 24 percent. &quot;With improving consumption climate and the portfolio expansions which we undertook, we expect the first half of this fiscal to be better than the second half of last fiscal. We believe that's the space we will be in, and I don't see there will be acceleration from here. What we expect is that this gradual recovery will be sustained going forward,&quot; Tiwari told Moneycontrol.    The comments come as HUL reported a 6 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit in the June quarter but gross margins dipped 1.9 percent YoY, as the company remained competitive to maintain a volume-led growth even as volatility in commodity prices hurt its margins.    Hindustan Unilever stitches banking ties to fund ice cream biz post demerger    Hindustan Unilever absorbed most of the price inflation in tea, keeping the product affordable and thereby supporting volume gains. However, the company now sees price vs cost gap to narrow in the coming quarters.    &quot;The transitory cost versus price impact due to actions taken in the tea, homecare and core categories like Horlicks will reverse to some extent, going forward. After the June quarter, we expect gross margins to improve. But we are also clear that this improvement of sequential gross margin from the June quarter, will be deployed back and we'll invest back in the business across different lines of the P&amp;amp;L,&quot; Tiwari added.    The company is looking to step up investments in advertising and promotional (A&amp;amp;P) activties to shore up presence. It spent Rs 150 crore more in the quarter for A&amp;amp;P, with major chunk invested towards digital media.    &quot;With better disposable income, improving sentiment, and supportive macro conditions, we believe that from the June quarter onwards, we would start seeing a consumption uptick \u2014 and the industry has, in fact, been gradually recovering. We do believe that this gradual recovery which has happened, should be sustained.,&quot; he added.",

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Strong buying interest drove the Nifty PSU Bank to rally over two percent in trade on Tuesday, June 24, as investors piled their capital into shares of public lenders. The confidence in PSU banking stocks came after domestic brokerage HDFC Securities noted that the sector is seeing signs of a 'secular turnaround.'    &quot;The Indian PSU banking (PSB) sector, once considered structurally broken, is experiencing early signs of a secular turnaround, buttressed by a combination of governance reforms (balance sheet repair and recapitalization), modernized digital stack, and a gradual turnaround in the quality and sustainability of earnings,&quot; said the brokerage.    While the post-Covid PSB gross slippages (1.4 percent) have moderated below those of private banks (2.4 percent), PSBs have resorted to aggressive write-offs (1.3 percent of assets), reflecting in higher credit costs, simultaneously delivering an accelerated balance sheet clean-up.    The changes undertaken is beginning to reflect in PSBs finally stabilizing their loan market share (+52 bps market share gains during FY25), enhancing the quality of their customer franchise and service standards, and improving their return ratios.    At 12.30 p.m., the Nifty PSU Bank index rallied 2.3 percent, with Union Bank of India, Punjab &amp;amp; Sind Bank, and Canara Bank soaring up to 3 percent.    Follow our live blog to catch all the market updates    However, the brokerage noted that despite improving profitability (FY25 RoAs approaching 1 percent), investors remain skeptical of the sustainability of these earnings. &quot;Our analysis suggests that PSBs are on the cusp of a structural reflation in their core profitability trends over the medium-term,&quot; said HDFC Securities.    The brokerage added, &quot;We believe that the PSB universe selectively offers a favourable risk-reward, especially mid-tier PSBs with scalable franchises, clean books, and likely recapitalization triggers.&quot;    HDFC Securities decided to reiterate its highest-conviction 'buy' on State Bank of India with a target price of Rs 1,035. Across different market capitalization segments, its top 'buy' recommendations include Bank of Baroda with a target of Rs 290, Indian Bank at Rs 735, and Bank of Maharashtra at Rs 70.    Additionally, HDFC Securities kicked off coverage on Union Bank of India and Canara Bank with an 'add' rating and target prices of Rs 160 and Rs 110, respectively.

The top court\u2019s order came in response to a plea filed by investor Manu Rishi Gupta, who had challenged the fairness of the share valuation. He had also argued that the use of a reverse book-building (RBB) process could have ensured a better price for minority shareholders.    ICICI Securities was delisted this year in March and became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank. In his plea, Gupta said that the delisting process was not transparent and \u2018shocking\u2019 in its execution.    In June 2023, ICICI Securities had announced its plans to delist from stock exchanges and merge with its parent ICICI Bank.

Further, reports of HDB Financial Services' IPO, a key subsidiary of the bank, drove bullishness.    Jefferies remains positive on HDFC Bank, reiterating it as one of its top picks in the banking sector. According to the brokerage, the bank\u2019s management expects supportive policy measures to drive consumption and boost credit demand in the second half of FY26.

Follow our live blog to catch all the market updates    HDFC Bank has reaffirmed its loan growth guidance, which is expected to be in line with the sector in FY26 and ahead of peers in FY27. While net interest margins (NIMs) may come under pressure in the near term, Jefferies anticipates a recovery by FY27. The bank\u2019s asset quality continues to remain stable and healthy.    On recent allegations concerning the bank and its CEO, Jefferies sees them as a non-event, though it acknowledges the surrounding noise.    Further, HDFC Bank shares are in the news as its key subsidiary HDB Financial Services gears up for its public issue. Moneycontrol exclusively reported that HDB Financial Services is planning to launch its much-anticipated Rs 12,500-crore IPO, India's biggest ever by an NBFC, by June-end.    &quot;The UDRHP (updated draft red herring prospectus) has been filed and the plan is for the red herring prospectus to be submitted in a few days, followed by the anchor portion on June 24. As of now, the target is to open the issue for public subscription between June 25 to June 27,&quot; two persons said.    One of them added that if there were any sudden, adverse events, change in market conditions or unexpected delays, then the above dates may change. A third person said that HDB Financial Services is targeting a post-money valuation of around $7.2 bn (around Rs 62,000 crore) at the higher end of the price band.

        "Content": "The Nifty Bank index dropped over 1 percent (nearly 530 points) to stand at 48,452 on February 24. This comes as bank stocks including IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others tumbled up to 2 percent.    The banking index has now extended losses for the third consecutive session. This comes amid sell-off from foreign portfolio investors, who have substantial exposure to the sector.    IndusInd Bank shares were the top loser on the Nifty Bank index, falling over 1.6 percent to trade at Rs 1,027 apiece. Heavyweight HDFC Bank also recorded strong losses, falling nearly 1.4 percent to trade at Rs 1,669 per share. ICICI Bank shares meanwhile dropped 1.29 percent to trade at Rs 1,217 apiece.    Bank of Baroda, IDFC First Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Axis Bank and AU Small Finance Bank shares were trading in the red with minor losses.    Despite the market downturn, few bank stocks bucked the trend to trade in the green. Federal Bank shares rose over 1 percent to trade at Rs 182 apiece. Notably, Motilal Oswal has maintained its 'BUY' rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 225 per share. This implies an upside potential of nearly 24 percent from the current trading level.    Kotak Mahindra Bank shares were trading with minor gains.    Notably, the ongoing market downturn comes amid a persistent selloff fueled by several factors. The concerns over US President Donald Trump's possible tariffs, persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, and weak global cues are some of them.    &quot;The market is facing headwinds from relentless FII selling and global uncertainties over Trump tariffs. The sharp rise in Chinese stocks is another near-term challenge. In the US, long-term inflation expectations are rising, reducing the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve,&quot; said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

        "Content": "Shares of ICICI Bank Ltd, India's second-largest private lender, gained in trade on Monday, July 21, after investors and experts were positive of the bank's beat on net interest margins (NIMs) for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.    ICICI Bank reported a 15 percent year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs 12,768.21 crore for the fiscal first quarter, beating analyst expectations. NII (net interest income), which are the difference between interest earned and interest expended, stood at Rs 21,634.46 crore for the June quarter, up 8.4 percent on-year.    Total income (standalone) rose to Rs 51,451.81 crore, compared to Rs 45,997.70 crore in the year-ago period. Other income surged to Rs 8,504.90 crore from Rs 7,001.92 crore a year earlier.    Further, net interest margins contracted by 7 basis points to 4.34 percent. Going ahead, the management expects that margins would to be rangebound as recent rate cuts are yet to play out.    &quot;The full impact of the recent rate cuts is yet to play out completely \u2014 the February and April cuts have largely flowed through the loan book already, while the June cut is expected to reflect more in Q2,&quot; the management said in its post-results analyst call.    At 9.38 a.m., shares of the bank were quoting Rs 1,445.6, up 1.4 percent on the NSE.    Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of ICICI Bank?    Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said, &quot;ICICI Bank\u2019s results epitomize the saying, \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going.\u201d Over the past few years, irrespective of the sectoral challenges such as unsecured asset quality issues, systemic growth moderation, liability accretion or NIM headwinds, the bank has been able to deliver a stellar performance, beating Street expectations.&quot;    The brokerage said that ICICI Bank remains its preferred 'buy' in the sector, with an increased price target of Rs 1,670 per share.    Emkay Global noted that ICICI Bank reported a resilient performance, with limited margin compression at 7 bps QoQ to 4.34 percent, compared to peers\u2019 15 bps drop, and nearly stable asset quality with headline GNPA ratio at 1.7 percent. This, coupled with higher treasury/dividend income, partly offset by higher provisions, led to a PAT beat. The brokerage maintained its 'buy' rating, with a price target of Rs 1,600 per share.    ICICI Bank's reported NIM decreased 7 bps QoQ in Q1FY26 while core NIM fell only 4 bps QoQ, beating estimates of 12-15 bps decline. &quot;ICICI Bank is the only bank to post a beat on NIM so far. Even with a lower share of wholesale, the bank has seen a faster repricing of liabilities versus peers including HDFC Bank, highlighting its excellent liability strategy,&quot; adds Nuvama Institutional Equities.    The brokerage kept its 'buy' call intact, with a price target of Rs 1,600 per share, believing the bank is well positioned to deliver 2.1-2.3 percent RoA  over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, improving fee and contained LLP.

        "Author": "Ashwin Mohan",
        "Content": "The nation's top insurer and largest institutional investor in the stock markets, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has emerged as the biggest anchor investor in the initial public offering (IPO) of HDFC Bank's subsidiary HDB Financial Services, according to a disclosure. The total amount allocated to LIC in the anchor book portion is around Rs 220 crore, which represents 6.53 percent of the total allocations.    The NBFC raised a total of Rs 3,369 crore from a combined list of 141 anchor investors ahead of its issue at a price of Rs 740/share. The list includes the likes of ICICI Prudential Banking and Financial Services Fund, SBI Flexi Cap Fund, Baillie Gifford Pacific Fund A Sub Fund of Baillie Gifford Overseas Growth Funds ICVC, Government Pension Fund Global, Goldman Sachs Funds- Goldman Sachs India Equity Portfolio, Aditya Birla Sun Life Trustee Private Limited A/C Aditya Birla Sun Life Equity Savings Fund, Kotak ELSS Tax Saver Fund, Fidelity Investment Trust Fidelity Emerging Asia Fund,  several among others.    HDB Financial Services IPO opens on June 25: Institutional investors pick Rs 3,369 crore worth shares via anchor book    On June 20, Moneycontrol was the first to report that LIC was eyeing participation in the anchor book portion, an extremely rare bet by the insurance behemoth in the IPO of a private sector firm.    In an IPO, anchor book investors are typically institutional investors who are allocated a significant number of shares at a fixed price before the issue opens for public subscription. Anchor investors must make a minimum investment of Rs 10 crore.    HDB Financial Services will launch it's much anticipated Rs 12,500 crore IPO - India's biggest ever by an NBFC - between June 25 to 27. The price band has been set at Rs 700-Rs 740/share.    On June 16, Moneycontrol was also the first to report that HDB Financial Services was likely to launch its IPO by the end of June, targeting a post-money valuation of around $7.2 billion (around Rs 62,000 crore) at the higher end of the price band.    LIC, which has supported multiple public sector IPO's and disinvestment programmes by the government in the past, has bet on the record Rs 27,870 crore Hyundai Motor India IPO (outside the anchor book portion) and the Brookfield REIT QIP.    According to the DRHP, the HDB Financial IPO syndicate is a large one of 12 investment banks including JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities, Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Securities, Nomura, IIFL Securities, Morgan Stanley, Nuvama, Motilal Oswal and UBS. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is the company counsel.    On June 5, the insurance behemoth announced that the company's current executive director Ramakrishnan Chander has taken charge as its Chief Investment Officer. Earlier, on May 15, it announced the appointment of Ratnakar Patnaik as well as Dinesh Pant as its managing directors (MDs).    Life Insurance Corporation of India reported a 38 percent rise in its net profit for the fourth quarter ending March 2025, reaching Rs 19,013 crore. This marks a rise of 38 percent from the Rs 13,763 crore net profit recorded during the same quarter in the previous fiscal year.",

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Going ahead, the current chart structure indicates that the Nifty 50 may continue its consolidation for the next couple of sessions before picking its next direction, said Sudeep Shah, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.    He believes Poonawalla Fincorp, Britannia Industries, and Nykaa are in a strong bullish trend, hence it is a good time to accumulate these stocks for potential gains.    Further, he advised buying Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Sumitomo Chemical India for next week. &quot;Both stocks are trading above short and long-term moving averages, and also their daily RSI is in a super bullish zone,&quot; he reasoned.    Do you think the Nifty 50 will gain direction in the later part of next week and conquer 24,000?    FY 2025 was nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, defined by intense market swings and shifting sentiments. The year began with heightened volatility driven by the General Election, keeping investors on edge. This turbulence was followed by a spectacular rally, propelling the index to a fresh all-time high of 26,277. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the market entered a prolonged correction phase, shedding over 4,300 points in five months. Just when pessimism loomed large, March brought a strong comeback after finding support at 21,964. The index staged an impressive 1,900-point rebound in just 15 trading sessions, reigniting hopes of stability.    Finally, the financial year ended on a positive note, with a 5% gain. In recent sessions, Nifty has consolidated within a narrow 457-point range, aligning with our expectations from previous reports. Despite this consolidation, the index continues to trade above both its short and long-term moving averages. The momentum indicators cooled off from elevated levels.    Going ahead, the current chart structure indicates that the index may continue its consolidation for the next couple of sessions before picking its next direction. On the upside, the zone of 23,720-23,750 remains a crucial hurdle. A decisive breakout above 23,750 could spark a fresh rally toward 24,100, followed by 24,400 in the short term.    On the downside, the 23,400-23,350 zone serves as immediate support, as it is the confluence of the 100-day EMA, 200-day EMA, and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior rally (21,964-23,869). If the index slips below 23,350, the 50-day EMA at 23,114 will act as the next crucial support.    Do you expect the market to be strong in the month of April, considering historical data?    Tracking seasonality, over the past 17 years, the April month has often exhibited a positive trend for Nifty. On 12 occasions, the index has concluded on a positive note with an average gain of 4.48%, while on 5 occasions, it has ended on a negative note with an average loss of 1.16%. The average return for Nifty in the April series has been 2.82%. Over the past 17 years, April has consistently shown an average volatility of 7 percent for the Nifty index.    Will the Bank Nifty continue to outperform the benchmark Nifty 50, considering the technical indicators?    The banking benchmark index Bank Nifty ended the March month on a strongly positive note and snapped its 3 months losing streak. Finally, it has ended the month above 51,500 level with a gain of over 6.5%. On a monthly scale, it has formed a strong base near its 20-month EMA level and thereafter witnessed a strong rebound, which is a positive sign.    During the last week, the index marked a high of 52,064 level and thereafter slid into a period of consolidation. However, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising mode, and they are in the desired sequence, which suggests trend is strong. Further, the daily RSI is in bullish territory.    Going ahead, the zone of 52,000-52,100 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. If the index sustains above the level of 52,100, then we may witness a sharp upside rally upto the 52,800, followed by 53,500 in the short term.    On the downside, the zone of 51,100-51,000 will act as immediate support for the index as a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement is placed in that region. If the index slips below the 51,000 level, then the next crucial support is placed in the zone of 50,500-50,400 level.    Do you see the BSE reclaiming its record high in the coming week?    After registering the low of Rs 3,682, the stock has witnessed a sharp upside rally of nearly 49 percent in just 13 trading sessions. Along with this sharp rise, the stock has also surged above its short and long-term moving averages. The momentum indicators also suggest strong bullish momentum. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its northward journey and test the level of Rs 6,000 in the short term.    What are your top 2 picks for next week?    Kotak Mahindra Bank    Recently, the Kotak Mahindra Bank has witnessed a sharp upside rally and marked the high of Rs 2,202.50 level. Thereafter, it has witnessed a minor throwback. The throwback was halted near 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally (Rs 1,893-2,202). Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in a super bullish zone as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 2,180-2,160 level with a stop-loss of Rs 2,090 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,300, followed by Rs 2,350 in the short term.    Sumitomo Chemical India    The stock has given a downward sloping trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle on a daily scale. Currently, the stock is trading above its crucial moving averages, and they are edging higher. The daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 560-555 level with a stop-loss of Rs 535 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 590, followed by Rs 630 in the short term.    Is it the right time to bet on Poonawalla Fincorp, Britannia Industries, and Nykaa?    Yes, all three stocks\u2014Poonawalla Fincorp, Britannia Industries, and Nykaa\u2014are in a strong bullish trend. Momentum indicators and oscillators confirm positive strength, suggesting a favourable short-term outlook. Therefore, this appears to be a good time to accumulate these stocks for potential gains.

        "Content": "The Nifty 50 index wiped out the previous day's gains, closing 83 points lower on May 30 amid volatility and rangebound trading. The market showed a weak breadth, with 1,446 shares under pressure compared to 1,130 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to trade with a positive bias, albeit within a likely rangebound zone. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    Gujarat Pipavav Port | CMP: Rs 156.15        On the daily time frame, Gujarat Pipavav Port has confirmed a short-term trend reversal, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. Additionally, the stock has surpassed the past five months' multiple resistance zones on a closing basis, signaling a strong comeback for the bulls. This breakout is accompanied by high volumes, signifying increased participation.    The stock is well-positioned above its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), and these averages are also rising in tandem with the price action, reinforcing bullish sentiments. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Its expected upside is Rs 175-189, and its downside support zone is the Rs 150-142 levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 175, Rs 189    Stop-Loss: Rs 150    Central Depository Services (CDSL) | CMP: Rs 1,529.7        CDSL is positioned above its Inverse Head &amp;amp; Shoulders pattern, indicating bullish sentiments. The stock is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. It is also well above its 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which are all rising along with the price, confirming bullish momentum. The daily and weekly RSI strength indicators show rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Its expected upside is Rs 1,650-1,755, and its downside support zone is the Rs 1,480-1,430 levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,650, Rs 1,755    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,480    Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 238.66        Manappuram Finance is in a strong uptrend across all timeframes, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. The stock has decisively surpassed the critical resistance zone at Rs 236, along with a surge in volumes, indicating strong participation. This buying support has been observed around the 20-day and 50-day SMAs, which remain crucial support zones.    The daily &quot;Bollinger Bands&quot; buy signal indicates increased momentum, and both the daily and weekly RSI indicators suggest that buying could occur at current levels. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. Its expected upside is Rs 255-265, and its downside support zone is the Rs 233-227 levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 255, Rs 265    Stop-Loss: Rs 233    Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Ange One    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 776.85        HDFC Life has been in a consolidation phase for the past four years, with the Rs 750\u2013760 zone acting as strong resistance on two prior occasions. This key hurdle has now been decisively breached, confirming a long-term breakout. Volume analysis supports the move, as strong buying interest is evident during upswings, while downswings are accompanied by lower volumes, indicating underlying strength.    Recently, prices have been trending steadily higher, with dips consistently finding support near the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA). This suggests that buying interest remains intact, and we expect the positive momentum to continue. We recommend buying HDFC Life Insurance around Rs 777 - 770.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 830    Stop-Loss: Rs 751    Wockhardt | CMP: Rs 1,465.3        After forming a base near the 200-day SMA, Wockhardt witnessed a sharp rebound and recently broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern. This breakout is backed by a significant surge in volume, confirming a price\u2013volume breakout. The stock has closed above all key moving averages, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Additionally, the RSI has crossed above 60, signaling strengthening positive momentum. We recommend buying Wockhardt around Rs 1,465 - Rs 1,460.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390    Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments    Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation | CMP: Rs 1,483.7        Deepak Fertilisers has broken out of both a 104-week and a 28-week base-on-base pattern, with rising volumes confirming the breakout at Rs 1,430. Both daily and weekly moving averages are closely aligned with the price, serving as strong propellers for the ongoing uptrend. The stock is now targeting an upside of Rs 1,700. Recently, monsoon-related stocks have attracted fresh buying interest, with Deepak Fertilisers emerging as a clear leader within this segment, supported by strong accumulation.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,700    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400    Sundaram Finance | CMP: Rs 5,136.5        Sundaram Finance is on the verge of a bullish breakout from a 35-week-long Cup and Handle pattern. The volume profile is ideal, with low volumes during down weeks and strong volumes during up weeks, indicating institutional accumulation. The stock is currently resting on its weekly moving averages, which are well-positioned to act as a launchpad for the breakout. A successful breakout could lead to a 20 percent upside extension from the breakout point.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 5,935    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,000    GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals | CMP: Rs 3,298.6        GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals has broken out of a 39-week-long bullish Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly charts. Volumes surged during the bottom formation and the rally towards the neckline, while healthy volume contraction was seen during the handle formation \u2014 a classic sign of accumulation. The breakout above Rs 3,100 confirms bullish momentum, and the stock is now poised to move towards its breakout target of Rs 3,800, supported by strong price structure and institutional participation.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,200    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

VNB grew 13% YoY to INR8.1b in 1QFY26 (5% below our estimates). Margins stood at 25.1%, a 90bp decline from our estimate of 26%, primarily due to the shift in the product mix towards lower yield offerings. For 1QFY26, HDFCLIFE reported a 14% YoY growth in shareholders\u2019 PAT to INR 5.5b, (11% beat), supported by a 15% increase in back-book profits. VNB margins are expected to remain range-bound due to slower growth and the reinvestment of surplus into distribution expansion and fixed cost absorption.

        "Date": "2025-07-23",
        "Description": "Infosys has deployed over 300 AI agents across business operations and internal IP, reporting productivity gains in the range of 5-15 percent across client programs.",
        "Author": "Reshab Shaw",
        "Content": "Salil Parekh, the CEO of India\u2019s second-largest IT firm Infosys said the global macroeconomic environment is showing signs of stabilisation but still remains unsettled in parts, after the company raised revenue growth outlook for the current financial year (FY26).    \u201cDiscussions on the economy worldwide have come to a more stable situation, but it\u2019s not fully settled,\u201d Parekh said during the Q1FY26 earnings press conference. Infosys revised its constant currency (CC) revenue growth guidance for FY26 to 1-3 percent, up from the earlier 0-3 percent range.    The company reported a sequential revenue growth of 2.6 percent in CC terms for the quarter ended June, with large deal wins totalling $3.8 billion. The four-quarter high in deal wins was driven by traction in enterprise AI deployments and client consolidation, said Parekh.    Infosys highlighted that many clients remain focused on cost and operational efficiency, even those not directly impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen strong work with AI agents and benefit from consolidation. This gives us confidence to raise the lower end of guidance,\u201d Salil Parekh said.    Infosys has deployed over 300 AI agents across business operations and internal IP, reporting productivity gains in the range of 5-15 percent across client programs. \u201cThese agents are helping clients make faster decisions, improve customer experience, and increase operational efficiency,\u201d Parekh added.    Infosys' Q1 Performance    The IT bellwether reported an 8.7 percent on-year increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 6,921 crore for the quarter, beating street expectations. It also beat revenue expectations, which grew by 7.5 percent to Rs 42,279 crore.    A Bloomberg poll of brokerages had pegged Infosys\u2019 net profit at Rs 6,778 crore and revenue at Rs 41,724 crore for the June quarter.    The company is seeing sectoral pressures in manufacturing, logistics, and consumer products, along with renewed demand in energy, utilities and telecom.    In terms of regions, Europe continued to outperform North America, with year-on-year CC revenue growth flat in the North American region, while Europe saw a 12.3 percent rise. Still, North America remains Infosys\u2019 largest market with over 55 percent share.    The company maintained its operating margin guidance at 20-22 percent for FY26. The Q1 operating margin was 20.8 percent, with pricing improvements and seasonal tailwinds offsetting some investment-related pressure, Chief Financial Officer Jayesh Sanghrajka said.    Margins reflected a 100 bps impact from wage increases, partially offset by around 70 bps of benefit from improved pricing and seasonal efficiencies. Additional drag came from ongoing investments and third-party costs, Sanghrajka said.",

        "Content": "HDFC Life reported a 14 percent jump in its net profit to Rs 546 crore for the June quarter of fiscal year 2026. The company had reported the net profit at Rs 478 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.    The total Annual Premium Equivalent (APE) was lower than the expectations which stood at Rs 3,225 crore, against Moneycontrol estimate of Rs 3,273 crore. The retail APE stood at Rs 2,777 crore.    Individual Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) grew by 12.5 percent year-on-year.    The Value of New Business (VNB) stood at Rs 809 crore, against Moneycontrol estimate of Rs 834 crore.    The VNB saw a growth of 12.7 percent YoY and a 2-year CAGR of 15 percent with new business margins improving to 25.1 percent.    Vibha Padalkar, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Life, said &quot;Q1 FY26 began on a strong note, with healthy growth across topline, value of new business and steady margins. Individual Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) grew by 12.5% year-on-year, translating into a robust 2-year CAGR of 21%. We outperformed both the overall industry and the private sector, resulting in a 70 bps increase in our market share at the overall level to 12.1%, a new milestone for us.&quot;    The company\u2019s solvency ratio stood at 192 percent, well above the regulatory requirement of 150 percent.    Gross premium income for the quarter stood at Rs 1,487 crore from first-year premiums, Rs 760 crore from renewal premiums, and Rs 472 crore from single premiums, taking the total gross premium to over Rs 2,680 crore. Net premium income rose to Rs 1,446 crore.    Investment income for policyholders saw a sharp spike to Rs 1,459 crore in Q1 FY26 compared to just Rs 1.8 crore in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25).    The net yield on policyholder funds, particularly in unit-linked products, rebounded sharply with 9.5 percent returns (including unrealised gains), compared to -4.5 percent in the March quarter.    Operating metrics showed mixed trends.    The company\u2019s 13th month persistency ratio, an indicator of policy renewal, declined to 82.7 percent from 87.3 percent in the same period last year on premium basis, reflecting some retention pressure.    However, persistency in the 25th and 49th months showed improvement year-on-year. The conservation ratio for participating and non-par products remained steady above 85 percent, indicating strong policyholder stickiness.    Total benefits paid stood at Rs 867.9 crore, while the change in actuarial liability was Rs 1,701 crore, both reflecting higher scale of business.    Operating expenses for the insurance business rose to Rs 150.9 crore, while net commissions paid were Rs 174.9 crore, indicating continued investment in distribution.    On the shareholder side, investment income came in at Rs 32 crore and profit before tax was Rs 56 crore.    Net worth increased to Rs 1,701 crore, supported by Rs 1,416 crore in reserves.    Shares of HDFC Life settled nearly 1 percent lower at Rs 757.9 per share on the NSE, down 0.9 percent.

        "Date": "2025-04-05",
        "Description": "Considering the current chart structure, weak momentum, and cautious global sentiment, it seems the bears are likely to retain control on the Nifty 50 in the coming sessions.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Considering the current chart structure, weak momentum, and cautious global sentiment, it seems the bears are likely to retain control in the coming sessions, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.    According to him, unless a strong positive trigger emerges, a decisive bullish comeback appears unlikely in the near term.    However, he is bullish on Marico and InterGlobe Aviation for next week. &quot;Both stocks are trading above all short and long term moving averages. &quot;These averages in case of Marico are on a rising trajectory, which is a bullish sign, while momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in IndiGo,&quot; said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    Have you adjusted your overall trading strategy after Nifty lost 1,000 points from its recent swing high? What will be your strategy for the upcoming week?    Global markets were rattled this week (ended April 4) as a wave of risk-off sentiment swept across equities, triggered by the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on the US trade partners. The escalating trade tensions have reignited fears of a slowdown in global economic activity. As Wall Street tumbled and Asian indices followed suit, the ripple effect reached Indian shores, with the Nifty reacting sharply to the global sell-off. But beneath the headline noise, what are the charts really telling us?    Recently, the benchmark index Nifty has failed to sustain above its prior swing high and thereafter started witnessing gradual selling pressure. From the recent high of 23,870, the index has tumbled by over 1,000 points in just 8 trading sessions. Along with this fall, the index has slipped below its short and long term moving averages, which is a sign of weakening momentum. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trading below its 9-day average, and the fast stochastic has slipped below the slow stochastic line.    Together, these signals point to a clear loss of bullish strength and suggest that bearish momentum is currently in play. Sector-wise, the broader market is also under pressure. Barring a few pockets like private banks, select financial services, and FMCG, most sectoral indices are trending lower. In light of this, a cautious approach is advisable over the next few sessions.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 22,400-22,350 will act as immediate support for the index. If the index slips below the 22,350 level, then we may witness a further correction upto the 21,900 level in the short term, while, on the upside, the 20-day EMA zone of 23,100-23,120 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index.    Do you think the bulls can make a comeback and support the market, or will the bears continue to maintain tight control over the market in the coming week?    Considering the current chart structure, weak momentum, and cautious global sentiment, it seems the bears are likely to retain control in the coming sessions. While minor pullbacks may occur, the inability to sustain above key levels indicates continued pressure. Unless a strong positive trigger emerges, a decisive bullish comeback appears unlikely in the near term.    Will Bank Nifty be able to surpass the March swing high and easily reclaim the 53,000 level in the current series?    Bank Nifty has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions. While the Nifty has declined over 2.50 percent this week, Bank Nifty has remained relatively resilient, shedding just 0.12 percent. Notably, the ratio chart of Bank Nifty versus Nifty has hit a 67-week high, signaling continued outperformance.    The banking index is also holding firm above its short and long-term moving averages, with the daily RSI comfortably placed in bullish territory. This overall chart structure suggests that bullish momentum remains intact for Bank Nifty. Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 52,000-52,100 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index, while, on the downside, the zone of 50,800-50,700 will act as a crucial support for the index. If the index slips below the 50,700 level, then we may witness a correction upto the 50,000 level.    What are your top two picks for the upcoming week?    Marico    The stock has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices since the last couple of trading sessions. Despite the sharp sell-off in frontline indices, the stock has continued its northward journey along with relatively higher volume. Also, it is trading above its short and long term moving averages. These averages are on a rising trajectory, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 680-670 level with a stop-loss of Rs 650 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 730 in the short term.    InterGlobe Aviation    Since the last couple of trading sessions, IndiGo has been trading in sideways range, and it has formed a Bullish Flag like continuation pattern on a daily scale. As the stock is trading at an all-time high level, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI is in a super bullish zone as per RSI range shift rules. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 5,100-5,050 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 4,870 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 5,430 in the short term.    Do you expect the rally to sustain in Angel One and Power Grid?    At this point, it seems unlikely that the rally in Angel One and Power Grid will sustain in the immediate term. Both stocks have shown strong upward momentum recently, but Friday\u2019s session witnessed noticeable profit booking. The current chart structure suggests that they may enter a consolidation phase over the next few trading sessions. Additionally, the daily RSI for both stocks has given a bearish crossover, pointing to a loss of momentum and indicating limited upside in the short term.

        "Description": "The benchmark Nifty 50 may rebound in the upcoming session, but the 'sell on rally' strategy continues given the prevailing bearish sentiment. Below are some trading ideas for the near term.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices finished the rangebound trading flat on February 25, while the market breadth remained in favour of bears, with about 1,615 shares declining against 988 advancing shares on the NSE. The benchmark Nifty 50 may rebound in the upcoming session, but the 'sell on rally' strategy continues given the prevailing bearish sentiment. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Amol Athawale, VP- Technical Research at Kotak Securities    Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 227.23        On the daily charts, Ashok Leyland has formed a strong bullish series of higher highs and higher lows. Another important point is that the stock is currently trading well above both short-term and medium-term averages, suggesting that the uptrend is likely to continue in the near term. For positional traders, Rs 219 would be the key support zone. If the stock remains above this level, a strong upward wave is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could rise to Rs 240.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 240    Stop-Loss: Rs 219    Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals | CMP: Rs 564.2        On Tuesday, Chambal Fertilisers rallied by 4.9 percent and formed a long bullish candle on the daily charts. Technically, the stock is maintaining a higher bottom formation on the daily charts and is currently trading comfortably above the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages (SMA), which is largely positive. We believe that the short-term trend of the stock is positive, and as long as it trades above Rs 545, the bullish sentiment is likely to continue.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 600    Stop-Loss: Rs 545    HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,682.35        After a short-term correction, HDFC Bank found support near the 200-day SMA and reversed. Technically, on daily charts, the stock has formed a reversal pattern near the 200-day SMA, which supports a strong possibility of a fresh uptrend rally from the current levels. Looking at the overall pattern, it offers a buying opportunity for positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to the Rs 1,750 level.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,740, Rs 1,750    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,568.4        On the daily chart, Cholamandalam Financial Holdings recently broke out of the channel and, since then, has been consolidating in a range of Rs 1,430 to Rs 1,550 levels. In the previous session, prices finally managed to breach its resistance of Rs 1,550 level and also managed to close above it with a significant rise in volume. Also, prices gained more than 4% despite major indices falling, which is a strong bullish sign.    On the daily chart, prices have closed above their upper Bollinger bands, showcasing increasing bullish sentiment in the stock. Along with this, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) bullish crossover is acting as a double confirmation for our stance. In summary, the current trend for Cholamandalam Financial Holdings looks to have shifted to the positive side. A decisive break above Rs 1,605 levels is a must for bullish momentum to continue, with targets of Rs 1,680 followed by Rs 1,770 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,530 levels is the nearest support to watch out for!    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,680, Rs 1,770    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,530    Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,488.8        n the previous session, Bajaj Finance surged by 1.60%, outperforming both its sector and the Nifty\u2019s performance, which is a strong positive sign. Prices, after 7 sessions, have given a close above their prior candle\u2019s high, which is a bullish sign. Currently, prices are trading near their important resistance of Rs 8,530 levels. A decisive break above it can intensify buying pressure, leading to a move towards fresh highs. Moreover, Parabolic SAR dots have started to trade below the prices, suggesting that bulls are getting active in the stock. Also, the RSI is trading at 67 levels, giving prices the space to trend further.    In summary, the current trend for Bajaj Finance is on the positive side. A break above Rs 8,530 levels can further accelerate positive momentum towards Rs 8,870, followed by Rs 9,260 levels. On the downside, Rs 8,170 levels is the nearest support to watch out for!    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 8,870, Rs 9,260    Stop-Loss: Rs 8,170    TCPL Packaging | CMP: Rs 4,152.4        TCPL Packaging closed on a positive note with a massive gain of 7.79% on Tuesday. The stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern. The price has recently closed above Rs 3,830, confirming the breakout of the said pattern. After breaking out of the pattern, prices retested the neckline, and a sharp bounce on the upside was seen in the previous trading session. On the daily chart, the ADX (Average Directional Index) is suggesting strong momentum can continue in this stock, as it is showing readings of 35.70, which is above 25. For now, one should use a buy-on-dips approach to ride the trend instead of catching highs.    In summary, the current trend for TCPL Packaging is bullish. Use dips towards Rs 4,050-4,100 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 4,500-4,550 levels, as long as Rs 3,940 holds on the downside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,500, Rs 4,550    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,940    Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at Samco Securities    Nestle India | CMP: Rs 2,250.4        Nestle India has been consolidating near key support levels, setting the stage for a potential breakout. The stock is trading above the 10-day moving average (DMA), indicating strength in the trend. A steady rise in volumes suggests strong accumulation, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. The RSI is turning upwards, indicating improving momentum, while the stock remains resilient despite broader market fluctuations.    A breakout above its recent swing high could trigger a fresh rally, taking the stock to new highs. Any dip towards Rs 2,235-2,240 zones could offer a better buying opportunity. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP (current market price) for a target price of Rs 2,380. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 2,200.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,380    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1,641.4        Bharti Airtel is exhibiting strong accumulation near support levels, indicating the potential for a fresh uptrend. The stock has formed a bullish engulfing pattern on the daily chart, further strengthening its outlook. Volume expansion aligns with bullish momentum, and the RSI remains in a favourable zone, confirming positive strength. If the stock sustains above Rs 1,645, it may surge further. Additionally, any dip toward the Rs 1,630 zone may offer an opportunity to accumulate. Additionally, the stock is holding above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which adds to the bullish outlook. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP for a target price of Rs 1,715. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 1,605.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,715    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,605    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth of 3% each YoY for the quarter was impacted by softer execution, particularly in the process automation segment. Order inflows were strong and were up by 4% YoY and 39% QoQ on healthy base orders from railways, data centers, electronics, energy, tyres and water treatment, as well as large orders. With improvement seen in inflows, we expect revenue growth to scale up in the coming quarters.  Outlook  We trim our estimates by 3%/5%/5% for CY25/26/27 to bake in continued weakness in process automation segment. ABB is currently trading at 59.0x/53.8x on CY25E/CY26E earnings. We believe that beyond the transient weakness in execution as a result of weak inflows during last year, ABB has the right levers to benefit from improvement in government and private capex.

        "Date": "2025-03-18",
        "Description": "The rally in the bank stocks pushed the Nifty Bank index up by over a percent to cross 49,000 mark for the first time after two weeks.",
        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "Heavyweight banking stocks recorded strong gains of up to 3 percent on a day of across-the-board rally, taking Nifty Bank index higher by over a percent to cross 49,000-mark for the first time in two weeks, a crucial level cited by technical analysts.    &quot;The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 48,200 followed by 47,900 and 47,700. If the index advances further, 48,600 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 48,800 and 49,000,&quot; said Choice Broking's Derivative Analyst Hardik Matalia.    ICICI Bank shares were the top gainer on the index, rising nearly 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,303 apiece, higher for a third consecutive session, approaching its 52-week high of Rs 1,362 per share, supported by strong volumes.    IDFC First Bank, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank (PNB) meanwhile saw their share prices rise over 1 percent each. IDFC First Bank shares were trading at Rs 54 apiece, while those of Bank of Baroda and PNB were hovering around Rs 208 apiece and Rs 88 apiece respectively.    Heavyweight HDFC Bank shares also gained over a percent to rise for a third consecutive session as a major contributor to Nifty Bank\u2019s rally, after ICICI Bank.    State Bank of India (SBI) shares meanwhile were trading over 1 percent higher , recovering nearly 8 percent from its 52-week low of Rs 680 per share seen on March 3.    Canara Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and Axis Bank shares were trading in the green with marginal gains. Kotak Mahindra Bank shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 2,010 apiece earlier in the day.    Few bank stocks however bucked the trend to trade in the red. AU Small Finance Bank and IndusInd Bank shares were trading in the red with marginal losses. AU Small Finance Bank has made some marginal recovery after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 478 apiece earlier in the day.    The upmove follows buying action in Bajaj Finserv &amp;amp; Bajaj Finance on March 17, and a gains in shares of IndusInd Bank following RBI\u2019s comment that the lender is well-capitalised.    Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities said the banking index may have formed a bottom from where it may attempt a rebound.    &quot;For the Bank Nifty, a double bottom support is placed at 47700. As long as it is trading above this level, a pullback formation is likely to continue. On the higher side, it could move up to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), or 48600 and 48800. However, if it closes above 48800, the sentiment could change, and it may even retest the levels of 49500 in the near term,&quot; Shrikant Chouhan said.    A note by Axis Securities said the chart of Nifty Bank is showing a positive bias on the daily technical outlook, based on the Relative Strength Index.

Wall Street Futures also indicated a firm opening for US markets.    Technical view    Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said Nifty\u2019s weakness would likely persist if it stays below the 25,030 level. A move above 25,120 may trigger short covering, he added. On the downside, a breach of 24,920 could bring 24,000 back into focus, with intermediate supports at 24,800 and 24,450.

        "Content": "Equity benchmarks closed 0.2 percent lower after a choppy session on July 9. The market breadth remained favourable for bears, with 1,356 shares declining compared to 1,295 advancing shares on the NSE. The frontline indices are expected to continue trading within the previous week's range.  Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Mirae Asset Sharekhan    Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company | CMP: 1,563.1        Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company has completed the final leg of a symmetrical triangle pattern and has witnessed buying interest. On the weekly timeframe, it has taken support at the 20-week moving average (Rs 1,536). We expect the stock to trade with a positive bias.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,666    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,506    Bharat Heavy Electricals | CMP: Rs 262        BHEL has retraced 50 percent of its previous rise and has now resumed the next leg of its upmove. The rise has been accompanied by above-average volume, suggesting renewed interest in the stock.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 272, Rs 281    Stop-Loss: Rs 256    Power Grid Corporation of India | CMP: Rs 299.65        Power Grid Corporation broke out of a falling channel last week, then retested the breakout level and has since resumed its upmove. The daily momentum indicator has given a positive crossover, which is considered a buy signal.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 321    Stop-Loss: Rs 293    Sudeep Shah, Head \u2013 Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 680.35        On Wednesday, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance registered a Stage-2 Cup pattern breakout on the daily chart, accompanied by volume above the 50-day average, confirming the strength of the move. It is currently trading above both its short- and long-term moving averages, which are not only rising but also aligned in the desired sequence. Additionally, the daily RSI is in bullish territory and trending upward, further supporting the positive momentum. We recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 685-680 levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 740    Stop-Loss: Rs 655    Ceat | CMP: Rs 3,863.4    Over the past two trading sessions, tyre stocks have been strongly outperforming the frontline indices. Ceat has recently witnessed a falling channel breakout on the daily chart, followed by a steady upward move accompanied by relatively higher volumes. The stock is now trading above its key moving averages, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.    Technically, the daily RSI has crossed the 60 mark and continues to rise, while the MACD remains in bullish territory, staying above both the zero line and the signal line. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 3,870-3,850 levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 4,150    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,740    Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities    Apollo Tyres | CMP: Rs 473.9        Apollo Tyres has given a breakout above a falling trendline resistance on the daily chart, indicating a bullish reversal. It has also moved above both the 50DMA and 200DMA, reinforcing the positive sentiment. Volume has picked up alongside the breakout, adding strength to the move. Additionally, the RSI has crossed above the 60 mark and broken out of a downward sloping trendline, signaling strong momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 519    Stop-Loss: Rs 454    Dabur India | CMP: Rs 522.15        Dabur has given a strong breakout above a falling trendline, accompanied by a sharp rise in volume, indicating bullish momentum. The stock has also moved past the 200DMA, strengthening the positive bias. The RSI has surged above 75, suggesting strong buying interest, though it also indicates slightly overbought conditions in the near term. As long as the stock holds above the breakout level of Rs 510, the momentum is likely to sustain.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 555    Stop-Loss: Rs 504    Bandhan Bank | CMP: Rs 178        Bandhan Bank corrected down to the rising trendline on the daily chart before staging a recovery. It continues to sustain above the critical short-term moving average, the 50DMA.

        "Content": "The market maintained its southward journey for the sixth straight session amid volatility, but there was a strong recovery from the day's low, resulting in a moderately lower close on February 12. The market breadth remains weak, with about 1,613 shares declining against 974 shares advancing on the NSE. The benchmark index is expected to be rangebound, with support at Wednesday's low. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan    Indian Energy Exchange | CMP: Rs 171.81        Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) has completed a five-wave decline on the hourly charts and is now poised for a pullback of the fall. It has broken out of a falling channel on the hourly charts, suggesting a trend reversal. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover, which is a buy signal. Thus, both price and momentum indicators are suggesting that the positive price action will continue over the next few trading sessions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 178, Rs 183    Stop-Loss: Rs 166    SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 816.4        SBI Card has been in a short-term uptrend. It has broken out of a Bullish Flag pattern on the upside. It has taken support at the 20-day moving average (Rs 785) and resumed its upward move. The stock is likely to continue its uptrend towards Rs 865 from a short-term perspective.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 865    Stop-Loss: Rs 790    Vidnyan S Sawant, the Head of Research at GEPL Capital    Godfrey Phillips India | CMP: Rs 5463        Godfrey Phillips maintains a strong bullish trend on the higher timeframes, forming higher tops and higher bottoms while consistently respecting the 12-month EMA (Exponential Moving Average). On the weekly scale, the stock has rebounded from the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level of the prior uptrend from Rs 1,916 to Rs 8,480. On the daily timeframe, it has successfully retested the breakout level of a falling channel, reinforcing bullish price action. The alignment across multiple timeframes suggests a high probability of the stock resuming its upward trajectory.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 6,297    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,000    Blue Star | CMP: Rs 1,995        Blue Star remains in a strong uptrend, with dips finding buying interest near key moving averages. On the monthly scale, the stock has been rangebound, indicating high relative strength compared to the broader market. The weekly chart highlights a rebound from the 12-week and 26-week EMAs, forming a double-bottom pattern, reinforcing bullish momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,235    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,839    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 629.15        HDFC Life Insurance has been forming higher bottoms on the weekly scale since March 2023. In recent weeks, the stock has found support at the 200-week EMA, aligning with the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level, indicating a pause in the downward phase. A breakout above Rs 650 would confirm a positive structure. Additionally, the stochastic indicator\u2019s %K sustaining above 50 suggests improving bullish momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 697    Stop-Loss: Rs 584    Sudeep Shah, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1,711.55        Bharti Airtel has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices. The ratio chart of the stock compared to the Nifty index is at a 161-month high. The Mansfield Relative Strength indicator has been above the zero line for the last 277 trading sessions, reinforcing the stock\u2019s consistent strength. Currently, the stock is trading just a stone\u2019s throw away from its all-time high. All the moving averages and momentum-based indicators are suggesting strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,715-1,705, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,650. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,830 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,830    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,650    Cholamandalam Investment &amp;amp; Finance Company | CMP: Rs 1,351.85        Cholamandalam Investment &amp;amp; Finance Company has recently given a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout on a daily scale. It marked the high of Rs 1,401.45, and thereafter, it witnessed a throwback. Most notably, during the period of throwback, the volume activity was mostly below average. During this period, the stock retested the breakout level and witnessed a smart rebound, accompanied by relatively higher volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,355-1,345, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,290. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,450 in the short term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,450    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,290    DLF | CMP: Rs 680        The Nifty Realty index has been strongly underperforming the frontline indices in recent trading sessions. On Wednesday, it gave a horizontal trendline breakdown. The stock of DLF has also given a horizontal trendline breakdown on a daily scale. This breakdown was confirmed by relatively higher volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bearish candle on the breakdown day, which adds more bearishness.    Currently, the stock is trading below its short and long-term moving averages. Furthermore, the momentum indicators and oscillators are also suggesting strong bearish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend selling the stock in the zone of Rs 678-682, with a stop-loss of Rs 710. On the downside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 620 in the short term.

        "Date": "2025-06-05",
        "Description": "LIC Boosts Dr. Reddy's Stake to 8.216% via Market Purchase",
        "Author": "Alpha Desk",
        "Content": "      Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the country's largest institutional investor, has increased its shareholding in pharmaceutical major Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd over the last 7-8 months. Through a series of open market purchases, LIC acquired an additional 1,67,89,472 equity shares, representing 2.012% of Dr. Reddy's total paid-up capital. This acquisition has raised LIC's total stake in the Hyderabad-based drugmaker to 8.216% from the previous 6.204%.    The transactions occurred between October 28, 2024, and June 3, 2025, as per a regulatory filing made with the stock exchanges on June 4, 2025. The disclosure was made under Regulation 29(2) of the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.  LIC's Shareholding Change in Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.      Particulars  Number of Shares / Voting Rights  % of Total Share/Voting Capital          Holding Before Acquisition (as of October 27, 2024, or prior)  5,17,69,600  6.204%      Shares Acquired (October 28, 2024 - June 3, 2025)  1,67,89,472  2.012%      Holding After Acquisition (as of June 3, 2025)  6,85,59,072  8.216%        The Acquisition in Detail  The disclosure document reveals that Life Insurance Corporation of India executed these acquisitions through &quot;MARKET PURCHASE&quot; on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE, where Dr. Reddy's Laboratories' shares are listed. Prior to this series of acquisitions, LIC held 5,17,69,600 shares, amounting to a 6.204% stake in Dr. Reddy's. The recent purchase of 1,67,89,472 additional shares has now taken its total holding to 6,85,59,072 shares.    The total equity share capital, or total voting capital, of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. considered for these calculations stands at 83,44,55,365 shares. The filing confirmed that the acquirer, LIC, does not belong to the Promoter or Promoter group of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. The disclosure also noted that the total diluted share/voting capital of the Target Company (TC) after the said acquisition remains 'NA' (Not Applicable) in the context of this specific filing, implying no immediate impact from other convertible instruments on this reported percentage holding.    The acquisition of shares was entirely in the form of equity shares carrying voting rights. There were no voting rights (VR) acquired otherwise than by shares, nor any warrants or convertible securities involved in this specific transaction that would entitle LIC to receive further shares carrying voting rights in Dr. Reddy's.  Regulatory Context: SEBI Disclosure Norms  This disclosure by LIC is in compliance with Regulation 29(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, often referred to as the SEBI SAST Regulations. This particular regulation mandates that any acquirer who, along with persons acting in concert (PACs), holds 5% or more of the shares or voting rights in a target company, must disclose any subsequent acquisition or disposal of shares or voting rights representing 2% or more of the target company's share or voting capital.    In this case, LIC, already holding more than 5% in Dr. Reddy's, acquired an additional 2.012%, thereby triggering the disclosure requirement. Such regulations are crucial for maintaining transparency in the securities market, ensuring that all stakeholders are informed about significant changes in shareholding patterns of listed companies, which can influence market dynamics and corporate governance.  About the Acquirer: Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)  Life Insurance Corporation of India is a statutory corporation established under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956. It is the largest life insurer in India and a significant institutional investor in the Indian equity markets. LIC's investment portfolio is vast and diversified across various sectors. Its investment decisions are closely watched by the market as they often reflect long-term confidence in the investee companies. As a major player, LIC's investment activities contribute significantly to market stability and depth.  About the Target Company: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.

Such moves by large institutional investors like LIC are generally perceived by the market as a vote of confidence in the company's fundamentals, long-term growth prospects, and management quality. The acquisition, spread over several months, suggests a strategic accumulation rather than a speculative trade.    For Dr. Reddy's, the increased holding by a stable, long-term investor like LIC can be seen as a positive endorsement. It may also provide greater stability to the company's shareholding pattern. While the immediate operational impact on Dr. Reddy's is yet to be ascertained, the enhanced investor confidence can be beneficial for the company's market perception and future capital-raising efforts, if any. The market will continue to monitor LIC's investment patterns as they often provide insights into the institutional outlook on various sectors and companies within the Indian economy.    The disclosure was formally made by the Assistant Secretary (Investment- Back Office) of LIC from its Central Office in Mumbai, and copies were sent to both BSE Ltd. and NSE Ltd., in addition to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.

        "Date": "2025-07-21",
        "Description": "HDFC Bank guided that it would accelerate growth in the second half of FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27. ",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "India's largest private lender HDFC Bank's shares were in the green on Monday, July 21, after reporting a 12 percent jump in net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Brokerages rushed to hike their target prices on the bank, expecting stronger growth in the second half of the current fiscal year.    HDFC Bank posted a standalone net profit of Rs 18,155 crore for the quarter ended June 2025, marking a 12 percent rise from Rs 16,175 crore in the same period last year. Interest income for the quarter came in at Rs 77,470 crore, reflecting a 6 percent increase over the previous year.    Net interest income (NII) for the quarter stood at Rs 31,438 crore, up 5.4 percent year-on-year. The bank\u2019s core net interest margin (NIM) slipped to 3.35 percent from 3.46 percent in the March quarter, as deposit costs rose faster than yields on assets.    Total operating expenses grew 4.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 17,434 crore, including Rs 6,158 crore in employee costs and Rs 11,276 crore under other overheads.    At 9.16 a.m., shares of the bank were quoting Rs 1,993.2, higher by 1.8 percent on the NSE.    Should you buy, sell, or hold shares of HDFC Bank?    Given a fortified buffer of provisions, which is a traditional strength of HDFC Bank, likely pickup in growth and stability in NIM in H2, Nuvama Institutional Equities reiterated its 'buy' rating, with an increased target price of Rs 2,270, from Rs 2,195 earlier.    Following the list of HDFC Bank's subsidiary HDB Financial Services, the bank registered one-off gains which it prudently utilized to shore-up floating/contingent provision buffer to the tune of Rs 10,700 crore, noted Emkay Global, making its balance sheet much more resilient.    &quot;With liquidity improving, HDFC Bank guides to further accelerate growth in H2FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27 and thus reduce the growth gap with large peers,&quot; added the brokerage. It maintained its 'buy' call; hiked the target price to Rs 2,300 per share.    HDFC Bank posted a steady quarter with a slight earnings beat due to tax reversals. The NIMs contracted 11 bps QoQ and is expected to moderate further in 2Q due to the rate cut impact, according to Motilal Oswal.    &quot;Business growth aligns with the bank\u2019s strategy to reduce the C/D ratio consistently, though the bank indicated it would improve its credit growth trajectory moving forward,&quot; added the brokerage, maintaining its Rs 2,300 price target and 'buy' rating.

        "Date": "2025-02-23",
        "Description": "For Nifty, the zone of 22,600-22,550 will act as immediate support for the index. If the index slips below the level of 22,550, then we may witness a further correction upto the level of 22,250 level. On the upside, the zone of 23,050-23,100 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index, said Sudeep Shah.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "On the weekly charts, the index has formed an NR7 pattern. Historically, such patterns precede a surge in volatility and a decisive directional move, suggesting that a breakout or breakdown could be imminent in the coming sessions, said Sudeep Shah, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.    He advised betting on two stocks for next week - InterGlobe Aviation, and Garware Hi-Tech Films which both are trading above their short and long term moving averages.    &quot;Most noteworthy, in case of former, the daily RSI is in a bullish zone, while in case of later, the RSI is about to cross 60 mark,&quot; said Sudeep Shah with more than 18 years of experience in the capital markets.    Do you foresee the possibility of a rebound next week, considering the ongoing consolidation with support at 22,700 in Nifty after the recent sharp correction?    In line with our expectation, after the formation of the Record Session Count candlestick pattern, the benchmark index Nifty has taken a breather in the last week. The index has traded in a narrow range of nearly 330 points, which was the lowest weekly range since the last week of December. Throughout the week, the index formed small-bodied candles, signaling indecisiveness and a lack of strong conviction from both bulls and bears.    Despite consolidation in the frontline indices, the broader market indices, i.e., the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100, have relatively outperformed frontline indices. However, on Friday, both failed to sustain at higher levels and thereafter witnessed a correction.    Coming back to Nifty, on a weekly scale, the index has formed an NR7 pattern. The formation of this pattern indicates a phase of low volatility and range contraction. Historically, such patterns precede a surge in volatility and a decisive directional move, suggesting that a breakout or breakdown could be imminent in the coming sessions.    For Nifty, the zone of 22,600-22,550 will act as immediate support for the index. If the index slips below the level of 22,550, then we may witness a further correction upto the level of 22,250 level. On the upside, the zone of 23,050-23,100 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 23,100 will lead to an extension of the pullback rally upto the level of 23,400, followed by the 23,700 level in the short term.    The Bank Nifty has still maintained a higher high-higher low formation and remains in consolidation. Will there be a consolidation breakout on the higher side in the new series?    The banking benchmark index Bank Nifty has been trading in a range of 49,628-48,525 zones since the last six trading sessions. Due to the consolidation, the moving averages started losing their curvy nature. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) has been in a sideways zone since the last couple of trading sessions as per RSI range shift rules.    Going ahead, the index is likely to continue its consolidation in the zone of 49,628-48,525 level for the next couple of trading sessions. A decisive breakout on either side will lead to a trending move in the index.    Do you expect a strong upward movement in JSW Energy?    JSW Energy has been witnessing a pullback rally since the last four trading sessions, along with the relatively higher volume. On Friday, it has surged above its 20-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) level. The 20-day EMA has started edging higher. Further, the falling slope of 50 and 100-day EMA has been slowed down significantly, which is a bullish sign.    Going ahead, the stock is likely to continue its pullback rally and test the level of Rs 510, followed by 50-day EMA level, which is currently quoting at Rs 536.60 level.    Considering the Three White Soldiers pattern (not a classical one), are you bullish on NALCO and Hindalco Industries?    National Aluminum Company has formed a textbook Three White Soldiers pattern, indicating strong bullish momentum. With the stock surging past its 200-day EMA, we anticipate further upside in the coming trading sessions.    The stock of Hindalco Industries has not formed a textbook Three White Soldiers pattern, but it has given a downward sloping trendline breakout on a daily scale. Since the last three trading sessions, the stock has witnessed bullish momentum along with relatively high volume. Also, it has surged above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in a rising mode. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to witness bullish momentum in the next couple of trading sessions.    What are your top two picks for next week?    InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo)    Recently, the stock has taken support near its 200-day EMA level and thereafter witnessed a sharp upside rally. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages have started edging higher, which is a bullish sign. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI is in a bullish zone. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,520-4,490 level with a stop-loss of Rs 4,360. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 4,730, followed by Rs 4,850 in the short term.    Garware Hi-Tech Films    The stock has been strongly outperforming the frontline indices since the last couple of trading sessions. On Friday, it has given a consolidation breakout along with a relatively higher volume. Currently, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is about to cross 60 mark. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 4,210-4,180 level with a stop-loss of Rs 4,360. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 4,470, followed by Rs 4,500 in the short term.    Has L&amp;amp;T bottomed out?    After hitting a low of Rs 3,183, the stock has seen a minor pullback rally, but with relatively low volume. It remains below both short and long-term moving averages, signaling weakness. Additionally, momentum indicators and oscillators suggest continued bearish pressure. Therefore, we believe the stock hasn't bottomed out yet.

        "Content": "The market extended its robust run for another session, with the Nifty 50 climbing 2.2 percent on April 15, following a positive global sentiment. Market breadth remained strong, with a total of 2,315 shares seeing buying interest compared to just 281 shares under pressure on the NSE. Bulls are expected to maintain tight control over Dalal Street, despite the possibility of intermittent consolidation. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Amol Athawale, VP-technical research at Kotak Securities    Prestige Estates Projects | CMP: Rs 1,198.5        After a decline from higher levels, Prestige Estates Projects has rebounded from its support zone on both the daily and weekly charts. Moreover, a sloping trendline breakout has occurred along with decent volume activity. The counter is witnessing a steady recovery from lower levels. This up move suggests a new leg of the bullish trend in the near term.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,280    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,155    Tata Communications | CMP: Rs 1,591        Following a sharp uptrend, Tata Communications experienced some selling pressure. However, the downward momentum has paused and the stock has found support. On the daily chart, a Cup and Handle formation has emerged, and a fresh breakout from the resistance zone is very likely in the coming trading sessions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,700    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,530    Bank of Baroda | CMP: Rs 235        After a remarkable up move, Bank of Baroda has been consolidating over the last few sessions. This range-bound structure suggests a bullish continuation chart pattern. Furthermore, the stock comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, it is likely to resume its uptrend from the current levels in the near future.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 250    Stop-Loss: Rs 225    Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities    Jagran Prakashan | CMP: Rs 72.9        Jagran Prakashan is in a healthy short-term uptrend. After a recent correction, the stock bounced from around Rs 66 levels, where it also formed a double bottom. This week, it managed to cross its previous swing high of Rs 72 on the back of above-average volumes and also closed above key moving averages. Momentum indicators like the 14-day RSI are also rising, which supports the continuation of the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 78    Stop-Loss: Rs Rs 70    BHEL | CMP: Rs 221.8        Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) is in a healthy uptrend and has recently bounced from the 50-day SMA. On Tuesday, the stock also closed above its recent swing highs on the back of healthy volumes. Momentum readings such as the 14-day RSI are rising, which bodes well for the continuation of the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 240    Stop-Loss: Rs Rs 210    FSN E-Commerce Ventures | CMP: Rs 185.86        Nykaa is in a short-term uptrend, forming higher tops and higher bottoms over the past few weeks. Last week, the stock bounced from the 20-day SMA and on Tuesday crossed its previous swing high with above-average volumes. The 14-day RSI is also rising and is above its 9-day EMA, indicating strengthening momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 196    Stop-Loss: Rs 177    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 704.7        Since the beginning of March 2025, HDFC Life has been steadily rising, forming higher highs and higher lows. Each decline in this upward trend toward the Ichimoku cloud's base line (red) has provided a buying opportunity, with prices consistently reversing from that level\u2014most recently as well. Support, based on this indicator, is around Rs 660. As long as prices stay above this level, the medium-term trend is likely to remain positive. A break above Rs 710 can lift prices higher toward Rs 738, followed by Rs 767, as long as Rs 682 remains protected on the downside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 738, Rs 767    Stop-Loss: Rs 682    PB Fintech | CMP: Rs 1,619.6        For the past two trading sessions, PB Fintech has managed to protect its prior day's low on a closing basis, which indicates increasing bullishness. On the daily chart, the 5-day EMA has crossed above the 13-day EMA\u2014 a bullish crossover that suggests the short-term bias has turned positive. Additionally, the recent rise has retraced more than 23.6% of the prior fall that began in January 2025.    A retracement to 38.2% is expected, which corresponds to Rs 1,667 and is close to the previous swing high of Rs 1,700. In summary, the trend appears to have shifted in favour of the bulls. A break above Rs 1,630 is essential for the uptrend to extend toward Rs 1,700, followed by Rs 1,755. On the downside, Rs 1,565 is the nearest support level to watch.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,700, Rs 1,755    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565    Paradeep Phosphates | CMP: Rs 133        Paradeep Phosphates had been forming a rounding bottom since January 2025 on the daily timeframe. In the previous session, the stock finally gave a breakout by closing above the neckline at Rs 130.50, confirming the pattern's breakout. The ADX (Average Directional Index), which indicates trend strength, is now reading 37, suggesting strong momentum is likely to continue.    Given the sharp rise in the previous session, a &quot;buy on dips&quot; strategy appears prudent to ride the trend effectively. In summary, the trend for Paradeep Phosphates remains bullish. Use dips toward Rs 130\u2013132 as a buying opportunity for a move toward Rs 143, as long as Rs 128 holds on the downside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 143    Stop-Loss: Rs 128    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It had an impressive run in competitive bids, winning 24 transmission projects (market share of &amp;gt;50%) with estimated cost of INR 920bn; the most notable was Khavda-Nagpur HVDC project worth INR 250bn. As a result, its work in hand remains robust at INR 1.55trn. It has also pushed the pedal on execution with INR 263bn capex in FY25 (vs. INR 200bn guided at halfway mark). However, some of its ongoing projects experienced delays, mainly due to right of way issues. These projects are now expected to be commissioned in H1FY26. Power Grid estimates capex of INR 1,080bn for the ensuing 3-year period with possible upside risk.  Outlook  We estimate another INR 3trn of bidding in transmission over the next 3-4 years with the company likely maintaining its share of &amp;gt;50% in project wins.

        "Content": "Emkay's research report on ICICI Bank  ICICI Bank reported a resilient performance, with limited margin compression at 7bps QoQ to 4.34% (vs peers\u2019 over 15bps drop) and nearly stable asset quality with headline GNPA ratio at 1.7%. This, coupled with higher treasury/dividend income, partly offset by higher provisions, led to a 3% PAT beat at Rs128bn (up 15% YoY); the historically superior RoA came at ~2.4%. Credit growth moderated a bit to 11.5% YoY, owing to slower growth in retail loans, while the bank continues to accelerate growth in the better-yielding SME/BB segments. The bank believes that NIM should compress in 2Q due to swifter rate cuts, partly offset by the recent SA rate cut in June. Notwithstanding the expected near-term margin pressure across the sector (including for ICICIB),  Outlook  We believe the bank is well positioned to deliver 2.1-2.3% RoA over FY26-28E, aided by better cost management, improving fees, and contained LLP.

HDFC Ltd, the parent entity of HDFC Bank, later merged with its banking subsidiary to create the country\u2019s biggest private sector lender. The merger became effective from July 1, 2023.

        "Content": "Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Life Insurance  HDFC Life Insurance (HDFCLIFE) reported APE of INR51.9b (in line) in 4QFY25, up 10% YoY, driven by 9%/13% YoY growth in individual/group APE. For FY25, APE grew 16% YoY to INR154.8b. VNB grew 12% YoY to INR13.8b (in line) in 4QFY25, resulting in 13% YoY growth in FY25 VNB to INR39.6b. VNB margin for 4QFY25 came in 30bp above our estimate at 26.5% vs. 26.1% in 3QFY25/4QFY24, driven by higher rider attachment in ULIPs and sales of longer-term policies. For FY25, VNB margin was at 25.6% (vs. 26.3% in FY24). PAT increased 16% YoY to INR4.8b (15% miss) in 4QFY25. For FY25, PAT grew 15% YoY to INR18b, driven by back-book surplus. APE growth is expected to moderate in FY26 to mid-teens. VNB margins will remain range-bound as the company continues to invest the surplus in agent productivity enhancement and technology transformation. We have trimmed our VNB margin assumptions by 20bp/30bp in FY26/27, keeping our APE and EV estimates unchanged.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities's research report on JSW Steel  JSW Steel`s consolidated EBITDA beat BB consensus estimate by 5% as the overall performance in the standalone as well as the subsidiary level witnessed sharp improvement. The key driver was sequential increase of over INR 3,300 (+6%) in NSR across Indian operations coupled with lower RM costs (coking coal cost fell by USD 14/te QoQ). The operating performance would have been even better had the company not suffered one-time loss of INR 3.4bn on FX MTM on Euro loans and INR 2bn shutdown-related costs (together one-time cost impact translated to INR 800/te contraction in EBITDA). Though Q2FY26 realisations are expected to moderate, higher volumes, lower RM costs (iron ore cost to be down by INR 1,000/te) and absence of one-time hit are expected to neutralise the effect to a large extent.  Outlook  We are re-initiating coverage with HOLD rating assigning target price INR 1,010. We assign 8.0x multiple (near to 5yr mean for 1yr forward EV/EBITDA) FY27E EV/EBITDA.

        "Content": "Shares of Bharti Airtel are lower by over 2 percent in early trade on August 8, emerging as the top loser on Nifty 50 index following a large trade that saw nearly one percent of the company's equity change hands, worth Rs 12,563 crore.    Moneycontrol had reported a day before that Sunil Mittal-led promoter entity is looking at a part stake sale in the telecom major. &quot;The transaction has been launched at a floor price of Rs 1,862 per share, which is at a 3.15% discount to the last closing price,&quot; one of the persons familiar with the development had said. Indian Continent Investment, a Sunil Mittal-led promoter group entity that has likely trimmed its stake, holds 2.47% stake in Bharti Airtel.    After the June quarter earnings, Morgan Stanley had maintained its 'equal-weight' on Airtel, with a price target of Rs 1,890 per share. CLSA had kept its 'outperform' rating with a target price of Rs 2,035 per share. Macquarie, too, had maintained 'outperform' rating with a price target of Rs 2,050 per share after the Q1FY26 results. Read More    Bharti Airtel posted a robust free cashflow of Rs 14,500 crore and managed to trim net debt by Rs 13,000 crore sequentially to Rs 1.26 lakh crore in the June quarter. The telecom company is ramping up its fiber rollout from 1.6 million to 2.5 million home pass-ups per quarter, and is treating both FTTH and FWA under a single WiFi strategy. Airtel's ARPU rose to Rs 250, helped by a better subscriber mix and an extra day in the quarter.    Airtel's digital network across India and Africa now serve over 60 crore customers. &quot;Africa reported solid performance with 6.7% growth in constant currency. India Mobile business recorded a sequential growth of 2.9%, driven by continued focus on portfolio premiumization...&quot;, Gopal Vittal, Vice Chairman and MD of Bharti Airtel had said after the earnings.    Over the last five years, Airtel has invested over Rs 1.6 trillion in expanding its digital infrastructure, and the company has said in the past that the capex will trend down in FY26, with a large part of the heavy lifting largely done. The data center capex is part of the overall capex to be incurred by the company and is on track with previous guidance of around Rs 5,000 crore spread over three years.",

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices recorded a third of a percent loss on March 28 after a day of rally, with market breadth remaining in favour of bears. A total of 1,627 shares were under pressure compared to 985 shares that gained on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate further amid caution ahead of tariffs announcements by Donald Trump. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    Fortis Healthcare | CMP: Rs 6,98.35        On the daily and weekly charts, Fortis Healthcare has decisively broken out of its &quot;multiple resistance&quot; zone at Rs 680 levels on a closing basis, indicating a strong resurgence of bullish sentiment. This breakout is accompanied by huge volume, signifying increased participation. On the weekly and monthly charts, the stock is in a strong uptrend, characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a robust bullish trend. Recently, the stock has recaptured its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day SMA and rebounded sharply, showing buying force near the crucial support zone. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 777-830 and a downside support zone of Rs 670-635.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 777, Rs 830    Stop-Loss: Rs 670    Sumitomo Chemical India | CMP: Rs 559.35        On the weekly chart, Sumitomo Chemical India has confirmed a breakout from a &quot;down-sloping channel&quot; at the Rs 528 level on a closing basis, indicating a short- to medium-term resumption of the prior uptrend. The positive crossover of the 20- and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) signifies bullish sentiment. Huge volumes on this breakout signify increased participation. The daily and weekly RSI indicators have turned bullish, indicating rising strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 595-645 and a downside support zone of Rs 525-515.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 595, Rs 645    Stop-Loss: Rs 525    SBI Cards and Payment Services | CMP: Rs 881.1        On the daily and weekly charts, SBI Card is in a strong uptrend, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating bullish sentiment. On the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed a breakout of the &quot;Flag&quot; continuation formation at Rs 860 levels, suggesting the continuation of the prior uptrend. It is also well-placed above its 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), indicating a positive bias. The daily, weekly, and monthly strength indicators, RSI, have turned bullish, indicating a rise in strength. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock, with an expected upside of Rs 925-1,000 and a downside support zone of Rs 850-820.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 925, Rs 1,000    Stop-Loss: Rs 850    Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One    Hindustan Zinc | CMP: Rs 461.9        Hindustan Zinc has been experiencing a significant downturn over the past couple of trading months. However, the stock has reversed its trend with the strong formation of the \u2018Inverted Head &amp;amp; Shoulders\u2019 pattern on the daily time frame chart. It has surged above the 20-DEMA, 50-DEMA, and 100-DEMA in recent times, being backed by a rise in volumes, indicating a potential resurgence. Additionally, weekly indicators suggest a counter-trend, making this a suitable investment opportunity in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Hindustan Zinc around Rs 455-450.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 495, Rs 500    Stop-Loss: Rs 430    Ramco Cements | CMP: Rs 896.75        Ramco Cements has seen a decent recovery after a phase of consolidation and is now placed above the short-term EMAs and the 200 DSMA on the daily chart. The recent buying traction has been backed by a rise in trading volumes, attributing to positive developments in the counter. Additionally, the counter is comfortably placed above the SuperTrend indicator, adding to the bullish quotient. Simultaneously, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is about to surpass the Zero line from lower levels, suggesting potential momentum in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying Ramco Cements around Rs 890-880.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 960, Rs 980    Stop-Loss: Rs 840    Ameya Ranadive, Chartered Market Technician and Senior Technical Analyst at StoxBox    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 685.7        HDFC Life is maintaining strong bullish momentum, with an upside target of Rs 720-740. The stock is trending above key moving averages, with the 10-day EMA (Rs 653) acting as dynamic support. RSI at 70.42 signals strength but is nearing overbought territory, suggesting potential consolidation before further upside. ADX (Average Directional Index) at 26.80 confirms a strengthening trend, while the MACD histogram remains positive, reinforcing bullish sentiment.    Options activity and volume trends indicate sustained accumulation. A breakout above Rs 720 could lead to further gains, while Rs 650 remains a crucial support level. A close below Rs 650 would negate the bullish outlook, potentially triggering a pullback. The broader setup favors a buy-on-dips strategy, with momentum intact as long as the stock sustains above key levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 720, Rs 740    Stop-Loss: Rs 650    Allied Blenders and Distillers | CMP: Rs 306.2        Allied Blenders is exhibiting signs of a potential reversal, with a strong support zone at Rs 292-Rs 285, where the stock has historically rebounded, indicating robust demand at lower levels. RSI is near the oversold territory, with a prior bullish divergence, suggesting a possible recovery. ADX indicates strengthening trend potential, with rising buying pressure; a positive DI crossover could confirm an uptrend. Previous buy signals from similar levels led to significant rallies, reinforcing the bullish case. The MACD histogram is improving, signaling weakening bearish momentum despite a negative MACD crossover.    With a target of Rs 360-Rs 380, aligning with historical resistance zones, a reversal appears likely. A sustained hold above support could trigger an upside move, favouring a buy-on-dips strategy for traders.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 360, Rs 380    Stop-Loss: Rs 275    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Description": "There's renewed interest in FMCG stocks in recent past after income tax cuts in Budget 2025 are anticipated to boost consumption",
        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "The Nifty FMCG index remained in the green for the second consecutive session on February 25. The index rose 0.58 percent to stand at 52,587 as several stocks rallied.    The FMCG stocks had shown resilience on February 24. Despite market decline, the Nifty FMCG index closed in the green at 52,286. The index has continued its upward trajectory on February 25, suggesting investor interest in defensives during a market downturn that is extending to fifth straight month.    The shares of Colgate Palmolive were the top gainer on the index, rising over 2 percent to trade at Rs 2,527 apiece. The stock was followed by Godrej Consumer Products shares, which rose 1.56 percent to trade at Rs 1,061 apiece. The other stocks which recorded gains included Nestle India, ITC, Radico Khaitan, Dabur, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Tata Consumer, Britannia Industries, United Spirits and United Breweries.    However, few of the stocks bucked the trend to trade in the red. Varun Beverages shares crashed over 3 percent to trade at Rs 483 apiece, while Balrampur Chini Mills shares fell nearly 2.85 percent to trade at Rs 456 apiece. The shares of Marico and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble Hygiene and Health Care traded with minor losses.    Here's what brokerages are saying about the sector that found a fillip in income tax cuts in Budget 2025 to boost consumption:    'FMCG stocks a stable investment option'    Axis Securities said FMCG sector's &quot;structural growth trajectory remains intact, as several FMCG categories such as shampoos and premium detergents are still under-penetrated and underserved, particularly in rural markets&quot;.    &quot;FMCG companies deliver best-in-class return ratios, including high ROCE, ROE, and dividend yield, making them a defensive yet rewarding investment choice in a volatile market environment. The ability to generate strong cash flows and return capital to shareholders makes FMCG a stable investment option amid macroeconomic uncertainties,&quot; the brokerage said. It gave a 'Buy' call on the stocks of Varun Beverages and DOMS Industries.    Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, on FMCG:    Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, listed a number of factors that could act as a boost for FMCG stocks. &quot;Global headwinds continue to weigh on the domestic market, with persistent volatility causing uncertainty among retail investors, who generally have a lower risk appetite. Weak US consumer sentiment and tariff concerns may further pressure export-oriented sectors such as IT. Looking ahead, the pace of earnings downgrades is expected to ease, supported by increased government spending, lower interest rates, and tax reductions. These factors are likely to provide a boost to sectors such as FMCG, consumer discretionary, and banking,&quot; he said.

        "Title": "Infosys Q1 preview: 5 key factors to watch for",
        "Date": "2025-07-22",
        "Description": "With peers TCS and HCLTech struggling with weak demand, the Street will be keenly watching Infosys\u2019 commentary on deal ramp-ups, AI-led transformation and the pace of recovery in key markets",
        "Author": "Reshab Shaw",
        "Content": "As Infosys gets ready to announce its first quarter results on July 23, investors will be closely tracking signs of a turnaround at India\u2019s second-largest IT services firm after multiple muted quarters.    With peers TCS and HCLTech struggling with weak demand, the Street will keenly follow Infosys\u2019 commentary on deal ramp-ups, AI-led transformation and the pace of recovery in key markets.    While the Street expects Infosys to lead Tier-1 peers in revenue growth, the outlook for the fiscal remains clouded by macro headwinds and delayed decision-making cycles in client organisations.    Here are five themes to track in the Q1FY26 earnings:    Revenue Growth    Among Tier-1 IT firms, Infosys is expected to post the highest sequential growth in constant currency (CC). Brokerages Kotak, ICICI Securities and Elara have pegged CC sequential revenue growth between 1 percent and 1.6 percent, largely driven by higher billing days and strength in BFSI.    Most of this growth is organic with about 30 basis points (bps) of the 1.6 percent attributable to the recent acquisitions of The Missing Link and MRE Consulting, Kotak Institutional Equities said.    While this might prove to be a welcome turnaround after two quarters of muted performance, brokerages have cautioned against reading too much into it.    Centrum expects revenue growth to remain muted, with Infosys showing the best performance among Tier-1, citing macro uncertainty after the US tariff-related announcements.    Also read: TCS\u2019s Q1 show misses the mark; what this means for the broader IT landscape        Guidance tweak expected    Infosys is expected to raise its FY26 revenue growth guidance from 0-3 percent earlier to 1-3 percent, factoring in the contribution from acquisitions.    Several brokerages, including Kotak and HDFC Securities, see the move as conservative, reflecting continued softness in discretionary tech spending and caution in verticals such as manufacturing and retail.    \u201cDemand deterioration has been consistent with the companies\u2019 expectations, though a bit lower than Street expectations,\u201d Kotak analysts said in a pre-earnings note.    It added the muted environment is unlikely to result in a meaningful revision to full-year target.    Also read: Uncertainty cannot last long, FY26 international business revenue will be better than FY25: TCS CEO    Steady margins    Operating margins are expected to remain flat sequentially, supported by currency tailwinds and some leverage from revenue growth.    Q4 margins had benefited by 80 bps from reversals and additional tailwinds from lower variable compensation payout, Kotak said.    Q1 margins will likely be flat sequentially despite robust revenue growth due to wage hike for a few senior employees and large deal transition costs.    Infosys is likely to maintain its FY26 EBIT margin guidance at 20-22 percent, the range it has held for several years.    Also read: HCLTech plans restructuring, to reduce overseas headcount in FY26    Deal wins    Infosys is expected to report large deal TCV of around $3 billion, according to brokerages, while steady, the figure would reflect a year-on-year decline.    The market will also closely watch annual contract value (ACV), especially as many deals signed in recent quarters are consolidation-led or cost takeout in nature.    \u201cWe expect EBIT margin to decline around 25bps on headwinds from senior management wage hike, large deal ramp-up cost and increase in SG&amp;amp;A on account of marketing events conducted in US,\u201d ICICI Securities wrote in its research note.    The focus will be on the quality of the pipeline, particularly in GenAI-led or transformation-focused deals, which could provide longer-term visibility.    Also read: No strong co-relation yet that AI impacts hiring: Wipro CEO Pallia    AI, GenAI traction    Brokerages continue to flag Gen AI as a medium-term growth lever for Infosys but believe that the revenue impact is still limited. AI adoption is gradually shifting toward the production phase from PoCs focused on select use cases.    The Street will look for clarity on actual revenues being generated from these programmes beyond early pilots.    Gen AI-driven automation and its impact on pricing and project volumes will be an important area for management commentary, especially as clients look to cut costs amid tariff-linked uncertainties, ICICI Securities said.    Infosys may lead the Tier-1 pack in Q1 but the bar is low.",

        "Date": "2025-08-08",
        "Description": "SBI\u2019s home loan portfolio for Q1 FY26 stood at Rs 8.51 lakh crore as of June 30, 2025, marking a robust 15.05 percent year-on-year growth  ",
        "Author": "Malvika Sundaresan",
        "Content": "India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has reclaimed its position as the top home loan lender, surpassing HDFC Bank by close to Rs 8,000 crore after a two-year gap in the June quarter, securing a 0.95 percent lead over its private sector peer.    SBI\u2019s home loan portfolio for Q1FY26 stood at Rs 8.51 lakh crore as of June 2025, which is a 15.05 percent on-year growth. Home loans now account for 27.7 percent of SBI\u2019s domestic advances, the lender said. This portfolio is higher by Rs 8,000 crore compared to HDFC Bank, which became the market leader following its merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) in July 2023. HDFC Bank had reported a mortgage book of Rs 8.43 lakh crore for Q1FY26, which is a modest 0.9 percent growth over the preceding quarter and a 7 percent rise year-on-year.    The private sector lender now trails SBI after holding the top position for nearly two years post-merger.    According to the investor presentation, SBI also maintains a leading share in affordable housing loans, supported by government-backed schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and has seen steady demand from tier-2 and tier-3 cities where housing demand remains quite resilient.    SBI first broke HDFC's decades-long stranglehold on the home loan market in February 2021 when it crossed the Rs 5 lakh crore mark in outstanding mortgages. That lead was short-lived, however, as the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger in 2023 created a behemoth with a combined home loan book of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, surpassing SBI\u2019s Rs 6.4 lakh crore at the time.    State Bank of India on August 8 reported 12 percent rise in net profit at Rs 19,160 for the June quarter as compared to Rs 17,035 crore a year ago. Read More    Total income for the quarter rose 10.31 percent to Rs 1.35 lakh crore from Rs 1.22 lakh crore a year ago. Net interest income stood almost flat at Rs 41,072 crore, down 0.13 percent year-on-year, as the whole-bank net interest margin (NIM) declined 32 basis points to 2.90 percent, while the domestic NIM fell 33 bps to 3.02 percent.",

        "Content": "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ICICI Bank  ICICIB saw yet another good quarter with core PAT beating PLe by 3.7% due to better asset quality; core PPoP was in-line at Rs166bn. While loan growth was softer at 2.1% QoQ due to pricing pressure and slower system growth, reported NIM adjusted for tax refund of 2bps improved by 14bps QoQ to 4.4% despite tight liquidity. Due to RBI accommodative stance, overall repo rate cut is likely to be between 75-100bps compared to our estimates of 50bps. We revise our repo rate cut assumption to 75bps and trim NIM for FY26/27E by 9/7bps.  Outlook  however overall NII/core PAT would not change materially due to change in balance sheet base. While we are budgeting opex CAGR of ~12.5%, it can surprise positively as opex is likely to remain soft in a falling NIM scenario. We maintain multiple at 2.9x but our SOTP based TP increases to Rs 1,700 from Rs1,550 as we roll forward to Mar\u201927 core ABV. Reiterate \u2018BUY\u2019.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Hindustan Unilever on March 13 announced the resignation of Leo Puri as an independent director of the company. Puri citied growing board commitments, including his proposed appointment to the board of a global entity, among the reasons for his resignation,  which will be effective June 30.    &quot;Regretfully, I have had to take this decision to step down on account of my other board commitments, both domestic and international, that I need to attend to,&quot; Puri said in his resignation letter.    Puri also serves as the chairperson and independent director on the board of Fortis Healthcare and as an independent director on the board of Dr Reddy's Laboratories.    His resignation is also because of the so-called overboarding criteria for independent directors under the European Corporate Governance requirements, Puri said.    \u201cOverboarding\u201d refers to the event where a director occupies excessive number of positions on boards, which may result in an under-commitment of time and attention.    Puri, however, didn't name the \u201cglobal entity\u201d mentioned in his resignation letter and said he is awaiting approval from shareholders for his appointment at the company.    From June 30, Puri will also cease to be the chairperson of the risk management committee, ESG committee and independent committee of HUL as well as a member of its audit committee.    Puri will leave the FMCG major before the completion of his five-year term, which began in October 2023.    HUL shares were trading in the red with marginal losses at Rs 2,175 apiece.",

        "Description": "Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said: Seldom does a bank of the size of ICICI Bank surprise with its operating performance the way this bank has done.",
        "Author": "Zoya Springwala",
        "Content": "India's second largest private sector lender ICICI Bank's shares trimmed their intraday gains on April 21 to settle flat, after reporting a better-than-expected earnings show for the quarter ended March FY2025.    Brokerages rushed to upgrade their target prices on the bank. &quot;Seldom does a bank of the size of ICICI Bank surprise with its operating performance the way this bank has done, that too amid a volatile macro environment, elevated competition for deposits, and ongoing normalization in asset quality,&quot; noted domestic broking house Motilal Oswal.    For the quarter ended March, ICICI Bank posted an 18 percent year-on-year rise in standalone net profit to Rs 12,629.58 crore. On a sequential basis, net profit rose 7.1 percent.    ICICI Bank's gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio shrunk to 1.67 percent as on March 31, 2025, from 1.96 percent a quarter ago, and 2.16 percent a year ago.    Net interest income (NII) increased by 11.0 percent year-on-year to Rs 21,193 crore in Q4FY25 from Rs 19,093 crore in Q4FY24. Net interest margin was 4.41 percent in Q4FY25 compared to 4.25 percent in Q3FY25 and 4.40 percent in Q4FY24. The net interest margin was 4.32 percent in FY25.    At close, shares of the bank trimmed all wins to eke out minor gains of 0.1 percent, settling at Rs 1,408.1 apiece.    Should you buy, sell, or hold ICICI Bank shares?    International brokerage CLSA said that ICICI Bank delivered yet another strong quarter, prioritising profitability over growth. The brokerage noted that the NIM improved a 'surprising' 15 basis points on a sequential basis.        Global broking firms CLSA, Jefferies, and Nomura Holdings, along with domestic players Nuvama and Motilal Oswal all hiked their target prices on the bank's shares.    Discussing the improving asset quality, Nuvama Institutional Equities said, &quot;Asset quality in business banking is turning out to be better-than-expected despite high growth because the bank focused on the better-rated borrowers in this segment, does not lend at very high yields and has invested in sound credit models.&quot;    On this front, Motilal Oswal called the improvement in NIMs commendable. &quot;Our estimate of a modest NIM expansion in Q4 was not easy to achieve given the ongoing rate-cut cycle, but delivering a 16 bps NIM expansion, which has covered the margin fall over the entire year and taken NIMs back to the level seen in 4QFY24, was indeed very commendable.&quot;    Despite the positive reactions from all brokerages, experts noted that ICICI Bank's loan growth for the three months ended March at 13 percent on-year was modest, slipping to the low-teens. Global broking house Macquarie said the loan growth was lower than expectations. The growth was a tad lower than 14 percent in Q3FY25 due to slower volume growth in 'Personal Loan on Credit Cards', which has now bottomed.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Larsen and Toubro  Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;T) continues to beat order inflow (OI) expectations. It secured INR 766bn worth of orders in its core businesses (ex-services), up 40% YoY \u2013 aided by the energy (3.5x YoY; 41% of OI) and infrastructure (+2% YoY; 53% QoQ) segments. Order prospect of INR 14.8trn \u2013 international/domestic INR 9trn/INR 6trn \u2013 remains robust. We believe the order prospect for hydrocarbon projects is strong. While management guides for OI of +15% YoY for FY26, we expect L&amp;amp;T to beat its guidance comfortably. Core margin of 7.6% (flat YoY) was a tad disappointing, but we expect improvement over the fiscal. Note \u2013 the stock, at CMP, is trading at a lower band (25x FY27E core earnings) vs. historical valuation.    Outlook  Thus, we expect it to re-rate on improving core earnings growth.

        "Content": "Geojit Financial Services research report on HDFC Bank  Incorporated in August 1994, HDFC Bank provides a range of financial services including corporate and retail banking, custodial services, treasury and capital markets, project advisory services, and capital market products. In Q4FY25, HDFC Bank saw a notable 9.2% YoY increase in interest income to Rs. 86,779cr. The growth was primarily fuelled by a significant rise in interest generated from lending activities that was up 4.8% YoY and substantial increases in investment-related income (+23.5% YoY) and other banking funds (+49.5% YoY). Net interest income (NII) rose 11.3% YoY to Rs. 39,793cr driven by strong loan growth. Net interest margin (NIM) was stable at 3.54%. Pre-provisioning operating profit fell 6.9% YoY to Rs. 29,379cr, primarily due to a 25.5% YoY decline in other income. Nevertheless, the bank's operational efficiency showed improvement, with a 10.6% drop in operating expenses and cost-toincome ratio improving to 39.8% (down 150bps YoY). Reported profit after tax (PAT) ultimately rose 6.9% YoY to Rs. 18,835cr, driven by a substantial 72.4% YoY reduction in provisions, which was largely attributed to the improvement in asset quality.    Outlook  Therefore, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, based on 2.6x FY27E BVPS, with a revised target price of Rs. 2,192.

EBITDA margin (% of NOV) improved ~60bps QoQ in Q1FY26 despite adding 243 stores (ISec est.: 220) with steady take rate and contribution margin.

Management reiterated 2,000 stores target by Q3 and guided for 100bps adj. EBITDA margin expansion from pivoting to an inventory-led model. 70% YoY NOV expansion in Delhi, called out in the shareholder letter, is a key positive which explains Blinkit\u2019s aspirations to reach 3,000 stores in medium term. 13% NOV growth in food delivery, though lower than estimated, can be understood given the management transition.

        "Content": "Emkay's research report on HDFC Bank  HDFC Bank is gradually stepping up credit growth, although margin slipped by 23bps QoQ from a higher base in 4Q due to swift rate cuts and lower interest on IT refund. The bank registered one-off gains from HDB Fin OFS in the IPO which it prudently utilized to shore-up floating/contingent provision buffer to the tune of Rs107bn, with o/s now at Rs366bn/1.4% of loans; this hence makes the balance sheet (BS) much more resilient. With liquidity improving, HDFCB guides to further accelerate growth in H2FY26, in line with the system, and outpace the system growth in FY27 and thus reduce the growth gap with large peers. This, along with shifting portfolio mix toward retail/SME and substitution of high-cost eHDFCL borrowings with deposits, should drive-up the bank\u2019s margins over FY27-28E and in turn the RoA to 1.9-2%.

Post Covid-19, the Indian insurance sector has shown a remarkable growth, with gross premium growing at a CAGR of 9.7% from INR 5.7 trillion in FY20 to INR 8.3 trillion in FY24. We expect this growth to continue, with the sector poised to expand at a CAGR of 11.4% to INR 11.5 trillion by FY28. The key growth drivers include: Rising awareness regarding the need for financial protection among the masses, especially after the pandemic. A growing working-age population, currently standing at +900 mn individuals between the ages of 18-60 years. A market that is still relatively underpenetrated ($70 premium per capita), compared to $274 in China, $2,245 in Japan, $8,200 in the US and $900 of the global average, indicating substantial potential for growth. LIC, the market leader in India's life insurance space for decades, has faced increasing competition from private players. Aggressive marketing strategies, superior customer service, and innovative product offerings have chipped away at LIC's market share.    Outlook  On most metrics scores way above its peers and hence is our top pick in the life insurance sector. At the CMP of INR 687 the stock is trading at 1.9X FY27 P/EV. We initiate coverage at 2.4X FY27 P/EV (20% discount to its 3 years average) and recommend BUY with a price target of INR 870, which represents an upside of 26.7% over the next 24 months.

        "Date": "2025-07-16",
        "Description": "Both insurers are actively shifting from market-linked to guaranteed products and recalibrating margins impacted by regulatory changes, especially around surrender values",
        "Author": "Malvika Sundaresan",
        "Content": "In the first quarter of FY26, India\u2019s top private life insurers, HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, which came out with their earnings on July 15, signalled a common playbook: lean harder into protection, manage cost levers, and rebalance product portfolios amid market volatality.    According to a Macquarie research note dated July 15, while both players demonstrated moderate growth in key metrics such as Value of New Business (VNB) and premium income, they have also demonstrated sustained momentum in pure protection products.    Protection products are essentisally retail term plans that are less vulnerable to market volatility and policyholder behaviour.    Both insurers are also actively shifting from market-linked to guaranteed products and recalibrating margins impacted by regulatory changes such as surrender value norms.    Protection rising: A clear strategic priority    Both HDFC Life and ICICI Prudential continued to deepen their push into protection in Q1 FY26.    According to the company\u2019s investor presentation, ICICI Prudential reported 15.2 percent growth in total protection APE, led by a 24.1 percent surge in retail protection, a segment that MD &amp;amp; CEO Anup Bagchi emphasised as resilient and \u201cless dependent on market sentiment,\u201d in the company\u2019s analyst call.    The protection focus is reflected in the company\u2019s 36.3 percent jump in new business sum assured (NBSA) and a 17.1 percent rise in in-force sum assured, pointing to deeper risk cover penetration, according to a Macquarie report.    HDFC Life, too, saw protection premium inch up, 13 percent year-on-year, despite some quarterly fluctuations. While not as aggressive as ICICI Pru, it maintains a steady share of term products within its APE mix.    Group protection grew 8 percent sequentially, indicating continued traction among institutional buyers, said the report.    Margins under pressure, but also under control    At HDFC Life, VNB grew 13 percent to Rs 8.1 billion, but margins remained flat at 25.1 percent.    According to Macquarie, this was due to surrender value regulation changes and higher fixed cost absorption, which dragged margins despite strong APE growth. The non-par segment, typically a margin-rich line, fell 36 percent year-on-year, largely due to irrational pricing pressures and distribution recalibration, shrinking its share of the APE mix to 17 percent.    In contrast, ICICI Prudential Life\u2019s VNB margin expanded to 24.5 percent, from 24 percent a year ago, despite a modest 3.2 percent dip in VNB to Rs 457 crore. CFO Dhiren Salian attributed the margin expansion to a product mix shift toward non-linked and protection offerings, as well as improving cost ratios.    \u201cThe movement in margin is largely on account of the shift in product mix, and higher protection contribution,\u201d Salian said during the July 15 earnings call.    HDFC Life\u2019s CFO Niraj Shah further explained that while new business strain stood at negative Rs 133 crore this quarter, it\u2019s a standard feature of growing life portfolios. \u201cOnce we transition to IND-AS or IFRS, such mismatches will reduce,\u201d he told Moneycontrol.    Product mix rebalancing underway    At HDFC Life, ULIP and PAR products drove APE growth, together accounting for 60 percent of the mix, with PAR growing a staggering 117 percent year-on-year and ULIPs up 16 percent.    According to Macquarie, the rebound in ULIPs was contrary to what some private peers experienced and reflected differentiated distributor-level demand. However, this also leaves HDFC Life more exposed to regulatory risk, especially in bancassurance where 65 percent of its distribution comes via banks, mostly from HDFC Bank, the report said.    ICICI Prudential\u2019s product pivot leaned harder into guaranteed and protection products.    As Salian explained, volatile equity markets pushed customers toward non-linked savings, which grew 20.8 percent, while linked business declined 13.6 percent. Retail APE declined 9.2 percent year-on-year, but this was off a high base, and the two-year CAGR remains at a healthy 13 percent, he said.    Importantly, ICICI Pru\u2019s annuity business, which had driven strong growth in the previous year, saw a decline.    However, Rs 100 crore of single-premium annuities were written in the quarter, as reported by Moneycontrol earlier helped by declining fixed deposit rates, which have once again made guaranteed income streams attractive.    Cost-to-premium as a lever    ICICI Prudential Life\u2019s cost-to-premium ratio improved to 21.2 percent, down from 24 percent a year ago. For the savings line of business, this fell even more sharply, from 16.8 percent to 14.1 percent, as per Salian.    The company credited a leaner cost structure aligned with the emerging product mix and increased digital efficiencies across distribution.    \u201cWe are realigning costs in response to where demand is moving. Our focus is on growing absolute VNB, not artificially chasing margins,\u201d Bagchi said.    HDFC Life did not disclose the same level of detail on cost ratios but continues to invest in long-term distribution capabilities. Despite margin pressures, it reported an 11 percent rise in individual WRP, outperforming the private sector average of 8 percent and industry-wide growth of 5 percent. This gain in retail share may offset the near-term drag on margins from fixed costs, said Macquarie.    Persistency: Stable for ICICI, slipping for HDFC    Policy persistency offered contrasting signals.    ICICI Prudential\u2019s 13th month persistency held steady at 86 percent, while longer-tenure buckets (25th and 37th month) showed continued improvement, at 83.4 percent and 75.1 percent, respectively.    Persistency ratio typically is an indication of customer retention, particularly in protection and non-linked lines.    HDFC Life, however, saw its 13th month ratio dip to 82.7 percent, down from 87.3 percent a year ago. CFO Niraj Shah attributed this decline to timing-related premium lags and large-ticket policy churn following the March 2023 budget changes, which impacted high-value savings business.    In terms of solvency ratios, HDFC Life\u2019s solvency ratio stood at 192 percent, and ICICI Pru\u2019s at 212.3 percent.    AUMs also continued to grow, with HDFC Life\u2019s rising to Rs 1.63 trillion this quarter, while ICICI Pru\u2019s hit Rs 3.24 trillion, which according to Macquarie, is backed by high-quality portfolios and zero NPAs.",

Seldom does a bank of the size of ICICI Bank (ICICIBC) surprise with its operating performance the way this bank has done, that too amid a volatile macro environment, elevated competition for deposits, and ongoing normalization in asset quality. ICICIBC had earlier delivered earnings beats despite making large contingent provisions, though it was in a benign operating environment compared to what is prevailing currently. Our estimate of a modest NIM expansion in 4Q was not easy to achieve given the ongoing rate-cut cycle, but delivering a 16bp NIM expansion, which has covered the margin fall over the entire year and taken NIMs back to the level seen in 4QFY24, was indeed very commendable.  Outlook  We upgrade our earnings estimates by 2.5%/4.2% for FY26/FY27 on the back of positive NIM surprise and controlled credit costs. We thus estimate RoA/RoE of 2.3%/17.5% in FY27.

        "Date": "2025-06-20",
        "Description": "The anchor portion of the HDB Financial Services IPO has been reserved for June 24",
        "Author": "Ashwin Mohan",
        "Content": "The nation's top insurer and largest institutional investor in the stock markets, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), is evaluating the possibility of investing in the anchor book portion of the Rs 12,500-crore IPO by HDFC Bank's subsidiary HDB Financial Services, multiple industry sources in the know told Moneycontrol.    If the move fructifies, it would be a rare bet by the insurance behemoth in the anchor book of a private sector IPO-bound firm.    &quot;Discussions have been held in this regard and LIC is in the mix amongst other potential anchor investors,&quot; one of the persons quoted above said.    A second person confirmed the above. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity.    The anchor portion of the HDB Financial Services IPO has been reserved for June 24 and the detailed list of anchor investors is expected later in the evening on the same day.    An email query to LIC, HDB Financial Services and the issuer's parent HDFC Bank remained unanswered at the time of publishing this article. This article will be updated as soon as we hear from the parties. Incidentally, LIC holds 5.45 per cent stake in HDFC Bank.    In an IPO, anchor book investors are typically institutional investors who are allocated a significant number of shares at a fixed price before the issue opens for public subscription. Anchor investors must make a minimum investment of Rs 10 crores.    HDB Financial Services will launch its much-anticipated Rs 12,500-crore IPO - India's biggest ever by an NBFC - from  June 25 to 27.  The price band has been set at Rs 700-Rs 740 per share.    On June 16, Moneycontrol was the first to report that HDB Financial Services was likely to launch its IPO by the end of June, targeting a post-money valuation of around $7.2 billion (around Rs 62,000 crore) at the higher end of the price band.    LIC, which has supported multiple public sector IPOs and disinvestment programmes by the government in the past, has bet on the record Rs 27,870-crore Hyundai Motor India IPO (outside the anchor book portion) and the Brookfield REIT QIP.    On June 5, the insurance behemoth announced that the company's current executive director Ramakrishnan Chander has taken charge as its Chief Investment Officer. Earlier, on May 15, it announced the appointment of Ratnakar Patnaik as well as Dinesh Pant as its managing directors (MDs).    Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) reported a 38 percent rise in its net profit for the fourth quarter ending March 2025, reaching Rs 19,013 crore. This marks a rise of 38 percent from the Rs 13,763 crore net profit recorded during the same quarter in the previous fiscal year.

        "Description": "Nestle India and Hindustan Unilever shares fell after BofA downgraded the stocks to 'underperform' from 'neutral' and 'neutral' from 'buy'",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The shares of FMCG majors Nestle and Hindustan Unilever (HUL) dropped on April 2 after Bank of America (BofA) Securities downgraded the two stocks. Nestle shares dropped over 2 percent, while HUL shares declined around 1.4 percent.    BofA Securities on Nestle India:    BofA Securities downgraded the shares of Nestle India to 'Underperform' from 'Neutral', with a target price of Rs 2,140 apiece. This implies a downside potential of over 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 2,234 per share.    The international brokerage said that soft demand trends, cost pressures and aggressive competition from multiple players have made the operating environment challenging. This could affect Nestle India in the near term.    &quot;Pricing can remain a key growth driver amidst sharp inflation in commodities like coffee, cocoa, etc. that impact approximately 30% of portfolio,&quot; it said in its latest note.    BofA Securities expects some volume recovery for the company on a low base, but notes that the overall growth remains modest. It added that valuations remain elevated in the context of its growth outlook and its peer group.    The brokerage further cut the company's earnings estimates by 3 to 5 percent, factoring the recent trends.    BofA Securities on Hindustan Unilever:    BofA Securities downgraded the shares of Hindustan Unilever to 'Neutral' from 'Buy', and cut its target price to Rs 2,330 apiece from the earlier Rs 2,540 apiece. The latest target price, however, implies an upside potential of over 4 percent from the stock's previous closing price of Rs 2,233.85 apiece.    While the brokerage noted that the trends of the company are expected to pick up from the recent lows, it believes that the growth and margin recovery seem to be much slower than what it had earlier imagined.    &quot;General softness in consumption continues with the urban India slowdown and rural recovering only gradually. Moreover importantly, we see a substantial part of HUL's portfolio (c.35%) impacted by either cyclical/inflationary pressures (tea, soaps) or specific category issues (nutrition, mass skin, etc.) that weigh on overall performance. In our view, mgmt. efforts to invest in new high growth segments and channels is positive, but may not be enough to swing the needle for such a large business near-term,&quot; it added.    The international brokerage cut the company's earnings estimates for Q4FY25 by 2 percent and that of FY26/27E by 4-5 percent, citing macro and inflationary volatility.    &quot;We still like the long-term India Consumer story, though highlight that the aggregate growth of large companies is currently close to two-decade lows. It's a peculiar time where HUL is growing slower than Unilever. The recovery in coming quarters may be key in determining where the stock's rich valuations settle,&quot; it added.    Also read: Our LIVE blog on stock market updates    Nestle India shares have so far fallen over 18 percent in the last six months, while those of HUL have dropped over 23 percent during the period.

        "Author": "Broker Research",
        "Content": "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Infosys  The revenue growth performance (+2.6% CC QoQ) was above our estimates (+2.2% QoQ CC), attributed to broad-based growth in verticals and geographies. The BFS strength continued through this quarter as well, the mega deal within the segment further validates the healthy momentum in the vertical. The pockets outside BFS also reported positive growth, however the outlook remains weak on account of tariff uncertainties and geo-political tension. Despite the quarterly outperformance, the management is building caution around client sentiment and limited discretionary spends. The revised FY26 revenue growth guidance (1-3% CC YoY) translates to a revenue CQGR of ~-0.3%-1.0% CC. We believe, the revenue cannibalization through Enterprise AI and Agentic AI has been instrumental and supporting the client-centricity to drive efficiency and productivity. Additionally, the company\u2019s wider spectrum of offering supports active participation in vendor consolidation opportunities. On margins, the company executed well at the gross level (+70bpq QoQ) despite the compensation revision in Q1. However, the continued investments in fueling S&amp;amp;M engine created pressure at the EBIT level (-20bps QoQ). We expect the lower proportion of passthrough will be margin supportive, however H2 weakness and deal ramp up would provide lesser room for improvement.  Outlook  We are baking revenue growth of 2.4%/6.0% CC YoY along with margin improvement of 10bps/50bps YoY in FY26E/FY27E, respectively. We retain our \u201cACCUMULATE\u201d rating with TP of Rs. 1,750 (earlier Rs. 1,680).

        "Content": "ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company, the second largest AMC in terms of managed assets in India, has filed preliminary papers with the SEBI on July 8 to raise funds via an initial public offering.    The IPO will comprise a sole offer-for-sale of 1.76 crore equity shares by the foreign partner Prudential Corporation Holdings, with no fresh issue components.    This means the IPO proceeds will go to the selling shareholder, and the company will not receive any money from the offer.    Moneycontrol was the first to report last week quoting sources that ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company is likely to shortly file draft papers for up to Rs 10,000 crore worth IPO.    Since 1998, ICICI Prudential AMC has been operating as a joint venture between ICICI Bank and London-based Prudential Corporation Holdings with 51:49 shareholding.    Click Here To Read All IPO News    With over 30 years in the asset management industry, ICICI Bank subsidiary is the second largest asset management company in India, in terms of QAAUM (quarterly average assets under management), with a market share of 13 percent as of March 2025, serving 14.6 million customers.    If the IPO plan turns out successful, this would be the fifth listed firm from the ICICI Group, after ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company, and ICICI Securities. Additionally, this would be the fifth asset management company to list on the bourses, following HDFC Asset Management Company, UTI AMC, Shriram AMC, Nippon Life India Asset Management, and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC.    Led by Nimesh Vipinbabu Shah (the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer), and Sankaran Naren (Executive Director and Chief Investment Officer), ICICI Prudential AMC has reported healthy financial numbers in the past years. Profit in fiscal 2025 grew by 29.3 percent to Rs 2,650.7 crore, up from Rs 2,049.7 crore in the previous year, and revenue soared 38.7 percent to Rs 4,682.8 crore, up from Rs 3,375.9 crore in the same period.

This is the first time in Indian primary market history that the IPO is being managed by such many bankers.    ICICI Bank in its board meeting on June 27 this year has received approval for the purchase of up to 2 percent additional shareholding in ICICI Prudential AMC.    &quot;This purchase will primarily be towards maintaining the bank\u2019s majority shareholding in the event of grant of stock-based compensation by the company,&quot; the bank said.    On February 12 this year, the British joint venture partner Prudential PLC announced its intention for a potential listing of and partial divestment of its stake in ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Equity benchmark indices continued their upward journey for the second straight session, with the Nifty 50 reporting a gain of 148 points on May 26. The market breadth remained positive, with 1,604 shares advancing compared to 1,000 declining shares on the NSE. The market is expected to consolidate after the two-day rally and may attempt another session of upward movement. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    Great Eastern Shipping | CMP: Rs 931.8        While the shipping sector has already seen strong traction, Great Eastern Shipping has relatively underperformed \u2014 until now. Recently, the stock confirmed a breakout on the daily chart, emerging from a well-defined base formation. The downside appears limited as strong support has developed near Rs 825. Given this breakout and sectoral momentum, a fresh buying opportunity emerges. Investors may consider long positions in the Rs 920\u2013925 range with a target of Rs 1,125.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,125    Stop-Loss: Rs 825    Godrej Properties | CMP: Rs 2,246.9        Godrej Properties is poised for a breakout above its previous swing high of Rs 2,270. The price structure indicates a triangular consolidation, which typically precedes strong directional moves. In tandem, the daily RSI is on the verge of breaking past the 60 mark \u2014 a level that could spark renewed bullish momentum. A breakout above Rs 2,270 could open the path toward Rs 2,470. Buy only above the trigger level.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,470    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,170    Rail Vikas Nigam | CMP: Rs 412.05        After a brief consolidation phase, railway stocks are regaining strength, and Rail Vikas Nigam is showing signs of trend resumption. The stock recently witnessed a healthy retracement from its prior move (Rs 317 to Rs 447) and is now forming a bullish engulfing candle on the daily chart, indicating renewed buying interest and trend continuation. Traders may consider buying near Rs 410 with a target of Rs 440.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 440    Stop-Loss: Rs 395    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    HDFC Bank June Futures | CMP: Rs 1,944.7        HDFC Bank has been consolidating within a range of Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,000. The range has been narrowing, and it is likely to break out from this level, helping the stock inch towards Rs 2,060. There has been significant short covering, which has pushed the stock from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,950+. However, open interest (OI) has started to rise, and it is unclear whether it is due to short buildup or long buildup. Theoretically, it appears to be long buildup, hence pre-emptively recommending a long position. The price action will become clearer above Rs 1,980, so in anticipation of a breakout, one can go long on HDFC Bank Futures in the range of Rs 1,960 to Rs 1,950.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,020, Rs 2,060    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,890    ITC June Futures | CMP: Rs 435.6        ITC has been consolidating within a range of Rs 420 and Rs 440, and a breakout from this range is likely on the way up. The stock has witnessed short covering post its quarterly results, and the price action is indicating an upward breakout. Although the stock has a large Call base at higher levels, there has been unwinding of Calls and some additions in Puts. If a breakout occurs, further confirmation may lead to massive short covering by the Call writers, potentially resulting in a Call writer trap.

        "Date": "2025-03-14",
        "Description": "Currently, all three major US indices are trading below their short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in falling mode, which is a bearish sign, said Sudeep Shah.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities bullish on Kotak Mahindra Bank and Chennai Petroleum Corporation, which can add beautiful colours to the portfolio.    According to him, Kotak Mahindra Bank has been displaying strong relative outperformance against frontline indices over the past few trading sessions. Notably, the stock\u2019s ratio chart against Nifty has given a decisive consolidation breakout, highlighting its growing relative strength, he said.    On Chennai Petroleum Corporation, he believes the stock has formed a Three Outside Up candlestick pattern on a daily scale, which is a strong reversal sign. Most noteworthy, the reversal is confirmed by robust volume, he said.    On the global front, considering the chart structure, the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities believes the US indices (Dow Jones, S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite) are likely to extend their southward journey over the next few trading sessions.    Are the technical indicators suggesting a further fall in the Nifty FMCG index toward 45,000 before it starts an upward move?    From the recent low of 50,199 level, the Nifty FMCG index has witnessed a sharp pullback rally of 4.43 percent in just five trading sessions. However, since the last four trading sessions, the index has been oscillating in a narrow range of 1,143 points. On a weekly scale, it has formed a small body candle with long upper shadow. This show index has taken a breather after a pullback rally.    Most noteworthy, during the recent pullback, the index has failed to cross its 20-day EMA level. Further, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) also failed to sustain above 40 mark, which is a bearish sign as per RSI range shift theory.    Going ahead, if the index slips below the zone of 51,500-51,400, then the index may resume its southward journey. In that case, the zone of 51,000-50,900 will act as the next crucial support for the index. On the upside, if the index sustains above the 20-day EMA zone of 52,400-52,500 level, then we may witness an extension of pullback rally. In that case, the index is likely to test the level of 53,400, followed by 54,000 levels in the short term.    Do you have strong conviction that the Nifty 50 will decisively breakdown the 100-week EMA in the coming weeks?    Just as Holi brings a vibrant mix of colours, the market too has painted a dynamic picture over the past couple of trading sessions. In line with our expectations, the benchmark index staged a spirited pullback rally of over 700 points in just five trading sessions. However, on Monday, it hit a resistance zone at 22,670-22,700, where the confluence of the 20-day EMA and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior downward journey formed a barrier\u2014much like a playful splash of colours meeting a firm wall.    Since then, the index has been moving within a narrow 362-point range, reflecting a phase of consolidation rather than a breakout burst. Similar to how Holi celebrants pause before the next round of festivities, the market seems to be catching its breath. Technically, the index is likely to consolidate in the 22,700-22,200 zone in the near term. The daily RSI has been oscillating in the 42-39 range for the last six sessions, and the trend strength indicator, ADX (Average Directional Index) has been in a falling mode for seven sessions, signaling a lack of strong directional momentum.    We believe the ongoing pullback rally might still have a few more vibrant colours to splash on the market canvas. Talking about crucial levels, the index is likely to face an immediate hurdle at 22,670-22,700, as this zone marks a crucial resistance with the 20-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior downward journey (23,807-21,965) is placed in that region. However, if the index manages to surpass this resistance, it could extend the upmove toward 23,000-23,300 levels in the coming sessions. On the downside, the 22,300-22,200 zone is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    As traders, much like Holi celebrants waiting for the perfect moment to strike, patience will be key. A clear breakout will set the stage for the next big move. Let's embrace this colourful pause and prepare for the next vibrant market move!    Do you foresee a new leg of upward movement in Solar Industries and further correction in Indus Towers?    The stock of Solar Industries has given a downward sloping trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its northward journey.    The stock of Indus Towers has been consolidating within a narrow range of Rs 312-345 for the past 17 trading sessions. As a result, moving averages have started flattening, losing their curvy nature, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum. Additionally, the daily RSI remains in a sideways zone as per the RSI range shift rules, further confirming the ongoing consolidation. Given this chart structure, the stock is likely to continue trading within this range. A decisive breakout on either side will be key in determining the next trending move.    Which two stocks would add beautiful colors to the portfolio?    Kotak Mahindra Bank    The stock has been displaying strong relative outperformance against frontline indices over the past few trading sessions. Notably, the stock\u2019s ratio chart against Nifty has given a decisive consolidation breakout, highlighting its growing relative strength. Recently, the stock broke out of a consolidation phase on the daily chart, accompanied by a sharp rise in volume, confirming the breakout\u2019s credibility. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,990-1,970 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,920. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,120 in the short term.    Chennai Petroleum Corporation    On a weekly scale, the stock has formed a Three Outside Up candlestick pattern on a daily scale, which is a strong reversal sign. Most noteworthy, the reversal is confirmed by robust volume. Further, the stock is surged above its 20 and 50-day EMA level. These averages are started edging higher, which is a bullish sign. The daily RSI is surged above 60 mark, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 572-568 level with a stop=loss of Rs 545. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 620 in the short term.    Are the charts signaling more correction in the Dow Jones, S&amp;amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite?    Currently, all three major US indices are trading below their short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in falling mode, which is a bearish sign. Further, the daily RSI of all these indices is in bearish territory, reinforcing the prevailing weakness. Hence, considering this chart structure, we believe the indices are likely to extend their southward journey over the next few trading sessions.

        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "Cochin Shipyard shares rallied over 7 percent on May 15 after the company released its results for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2025. South Indian Bank shares also gained significantly, closing over 4 percent higher. ITC Hotels shares however tumbled into the red, closing with marginal losses.    Notably, the three companies released their Q4 FY25 results during the market hours of May 15. The Indian stock market experienced a significant rally in afternoon trade, with benchmark indices closing with record gains. Sensex jumped over 1,200 points, while Nifty 50 closed above the 25,000-mark for the first time since October 2024.    Cochin Shipyard Q4 Results    Cochin Shipyard reported a standalone net profit of Rs 285 crore for Q4 FY25. This marks a rise of nearly 8 percent from the Rs 265 crore net profit reported in Q4 FY24. Its revenue from operations meanwhile rose to 1,651 crore.    The company's net profit margin however dropped to 17 percent in Q4 FY25 from 22 percent in Q4 FY24. The revenue generated by its shipbuilding segment declined nearly 12 percent YoY to Rs 815 crore, while that generated by its ship repair segment surged by a whopping 178 percent to Rs 836 crore.    Along with the Q4 results, the company also announced a final dividend of Rs 2.25 per equity share for the financial year 2025.    In a recent note, Antique Stock Broking said the listed defence shipyard sector is looking forward to a near three-fold increase in order inflows by FY27, as the Defence Acquisition Council's approval of orders worth Rs 8.45 lakh crore begins to unfold.    Cochin Shipyard shares surged significantly, closing 7.27 percent higher at Rs 1,823 apiece. Notably, the sharp rise in the share price comes amid an overall rally in the defence stocks this week, after Indian armed forces successfully conducted 'Operation Sindoor' against terrorist outfits in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).    ITC Hotels Q4 Results    ITC Hotels reported a net profit of Rs 257 crore for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2025. This marks a rise of nearly 20 percent from the Rs 215 crore net profit reported in Q4 FY24. Its revenue from operations meanwhile rose to Rs 1,061 crore.    The company reported the opening of 16 new hotels during the entire financial year, higher than the 14 reported in FY24. &quot;Aggregate room demand in India is expected to grow ahead of supply. Further, potential for growth in foreign tourist arrivals (which still trail pre-pandemic levels by 12%) and Government\u2019s thrust on enhancing infrastructure and connectivity, boosting employment and promoting the tourism sector are expected to fuel growth in the Indian Hospitality industry,&quot; it said.    Notably, the company was demerged from its parent firm ITC effectively from January 1. The shares of the company were listed on stock exchanges later that month.    ITC Hotels shares however dropped 0.56 percent to end the session at Rs 200.81 apiece. The stock has so far risen nearly 17 percent since its January listing.    South Indian Bank Q4    South Indian Bank reported a net profit of Rs 342 crore for the fourth quarter of the financial year 2025. This marks a rise of nearly 19 percent from the Rs 288 crore net profit reported in Q4 FY24. Its net interest income meanwhile stood at Rs 868 crore, while net non-performing assets (net NPA) dropped to Rs 790.5 crore.    Along with the Q4 results, the lender announced a dividend of Rs 0.40 apiece.    South Indian Bank shares rose nearly 4 percent to close at Rs 27.80 apiece. The shares of the company have surged over 16 percent in the past five days and around 22 percent in the past six months. The stock is currently up nearly 10.5 percent in 2025 so far.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on IDFC FIRST Bank  We upgrade IDFC First Bank (IDFCFB) to BUY with a revised TP of INR 75, as the large proposed capital infusion (INR 75bn) improves visibility on superior loan growth/operating leverage (without any material dilution in book value) topped with inexpensive valuations. The announced preferential infusion to Warburg and ADIA should boost the bank\u2019s CET1 by ~280bps, catapulting its pro forma CET1 to ~16.5%. With a meaty share of fixed rate loans, at 60\u201365% of overall, ~32% share of wholesale TD/borrowings and an additional ~30% share of high-rate savings in overall funding, IDFCFB seems well placed on NIM and could surprise positively. MFI slippages have been elevated and could rise further in the near term, but the share itself is receding (now down to 4.8% vs. 7.2% YoY). Ex-MFI, gross slippages have been stable (though elevated) and are a key monitorable; but improved disclosures and contained SMA figures along with an improving overall asset quality environment provide reasonable comfort.  Outlook  We have not incorporated the capital infusion yet, as this is subject to regulatory approvals, but highlight no material change in ABV for FY26E/FY27E. We raise our target multiple to ~1.2x FY27E ABV (vs. ~1.1x) due to the potentially enhanced capital buffer and likely RoA revival (off low base) and arrive at a revised TP of INR 75 (INR 68 earlier).

Gross / EBITDA margins at 58.8%/20.4% were impacted by lower gRevlimid and PLI income and Pen-g plant cost (INR 500mn).

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Chemplast Sanmar  Chemplast Sanmar (CSL) has been enduring challenges over the past two years due to a weak cycle in PVC business; finally, early signs of consolidation have surfaced, and policy action should aid business recovery. CSL envisages ADD on S-PVC taking shape by Q3FY26 (hopefully positive outcome) while BIS norms implementation is pushed to Dec\u201925. Meanwhile, China has issued a draft policy of anti-involution on PVC; should this take effect, it may shrink excess capacities. Europe saw a few PVC plant closures too. CMC business remains steady and should benefit from a recovery in the agrochem business. Clarity on R-32 capacity sizing is awaited \u2013 needs to account for quota allocation policies.  Outlook  We cut FY26E/FY27E EBITDA by 39%/3%, assuming lower FY26 PVC spreads. Our SoTP-based TP stands at INR 515 (vs. INR 500 earlier); multiples unchanged. Retain BUY.

        "Title": "Chartist Talks: SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah bullish on these 6 stocks, but recommends avoiding fresh position in defence sector",
        "Date": "2025-05-18",
        "Description": "From a technical standpoint, the current chart structure suggests that the bullish momentum is likely to extend into the coming week, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities who expects the Nifty to move toward 25,300 in the short term, with the potential to stretch further toward 25,600.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "According to Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities, the Nifty Defence index is in overbought condition as per the RSI range shift rules. Hence, he recommends avoiding building a fresh position in the defence space as the risk-reward will not be favourable at current levels.    He picks Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, Rail Vikas Nigam for next week. &quot;GMDC has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale, accompanied by robust volume, while Rail Vikas Nigam has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale along with a robust volume,&quot; he reasoned.    Further, according to the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities, both Titagarh Rail Systems and Angel One are exhibiting strong chart structures, while the momentum indicators and oscillators are suggesting strong bullish momentum in IRFC and SJVN.    Do you see the Nifty 50 recording a 5 percent rally from current levels during the remainder of the month?    &quot;A weekend can change more than just calendars\u2014it can reshape market psychology.&quot; Last Friday, i.e. May 09, Indian markets were gripped by anxiety as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated, casting a shadow of uncertainty over investor confidence. However, over the weekend, a remarkable shift unfolded. The mood in the Indian financial landscape has turned decisively upbeat, buoyed by a confluence of calming geopolitical signals, encouraging economic indicators, and robust corporate developments. Together, these factors have not only altered investor sentiment but have also injected a fresh wave of optimism and confidence into the system.    The Indian equity market showcased this transformation in full force, as the benchmark Nifty closed the week (ended May 16) above the psychological 25,000 mark, posting an impressive gain of over 4 percent. What truly stood out was the powerful outperformance in the broader markets. The Nifty Midcap 100 surged by more than 7 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 rocketed over 9 percent\u2014its strongest weekly gain since June 2020.    This broad-based rally reflects a deepening bullish sentiment and growing investor confidence beyond the headline index. Sectoral rotation played a key role, with strong traction in Defence, Railways, Metal, and IT stocks, further underlining the healthy participation from multiple corners of the market.    From a technical standpoint, the current chart structure suggests that the bullish momentum is likely to extend into the coming week. We expect Nifty to move toward 25,300 in the short term, with the potential to stretch further toward 25,600. On the downside, the zone of 24,750-24,700 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    The swift change in sentiment has opened the door for renewed momentum and fresh opportunities. With strong sectoral participation and a clear upward trajectory, the market appears poised to build on this rally, backed by both technical strength and improving risk appetite.    How are FIIs currently positioned in the market?    In the last two trading sessions, the FIIs have aggressively purchased shares in the cash market to the tune of nearly Rs 14,,100 crore. This kind of aggressive buying has not been seen in the cash market since quite some time. In the index futures segment, after the long short ratio hit 50 percent on May 12, FIIs created short positions, which brought down the ratio to 38 percent on May 13.    However, the FIIs didn't continue to build more shorts, rather covered some short positions in the next few days with the long short ratio standing at 42 percent. Falling yields on US 10Y government bonds, fall in the DXY (dollar index), and the steady strengthening of rupee have led to aggressive inflows by FIIs in recent times.    Do you expect the Bank Nifty index to hit a new record high in May series?    Since April 23, 2025, the banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, has been underperforming the broader Nifty index. This is evident from the ratio chart, which has been forming lower lows relative to Nifty, indicating continued relative weakness. Despite this, the major trend of the index remains bullish as it is quoting above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is in bullish territory. From a price action perspective, the index is forming a stage-2 cup pattern on a daily scale.    Going ahead, the zone of 55,700-55,800 will act as a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above the level of 55,800 will lead to a sharp upside rally upto the level of 56,700, followed by the 57,500 levels. On the downside, the zone of 54,800-54,700 is likely to act as immediate support for the index.    Are the charts of Titagarh Rail Systems and Angel One looking strong? Would you recommend taking exposure to both at this stage?    Yes, both Titagarh Rail Systems and Angel One are exhibiting strong chart structures. They are trading well above their short and long-term moving averages, indicating a sustained uptrend. Additionally, momentum indicators and oscillators are reinforcing the bullish sentiment, suggesting continued strength. Given this setup, we believe both stocks are well-positioned to extend their outperformance in the near term, and exposure at current levels can be considered with appropriate risk management.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation    GMDC has given a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. In addition, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on a breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Currently, it is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. Further, the daily RSI is in bullish territory, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 355-351 levels with a stop-loss of Rs 340 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 380, followed by Rs 400 in the short term.    Rail Vikas Nigam    Rail Vikas Nigam has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale along with a robust volume. Further, it has surged above its 100 and 200-day EMA level. The daily RSI is surged above 60 mark, and it is in rising trajectory. The MACD histogram is suggesting pickup in upside momentum. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 410-405 level with a stop-loss of Rs 390 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 440, followed by Rs 450 in the short term.    Do you see a strong trendline breakout in IRFC (Indian Railway Finance Corporation) and SJVN?    Yes, both the stocks have given a trendline breakout on a daily scale. Most noteworthy, this breakout is along with robust volume. Also, both stocks have surged above their 200-day EMA level on Friday. The momentum indicators and oscillators are also suggesting strong bullish momentum in this stock. Hence, we believe they are likely to continue their outperformance in the short term.    Are you strongly bullish on defence stocks at current levels?    In line with our expectations, the Nifty India Defence has strongly outperformed frontline indices as it has surged by over 17 percent in the last week. However, as per the RSI range shift rules, the index is in overbought condition. Hence, we recommend avoiding building a fresh position in the defence space as the risk-reward will not be favourable at current levels.

        "Date": "2025-04-11",
        "Description": "Analysts expect Vodafone Idea\u2019s March revenue to see a drop of up to 2 percent due to subscriber churn ",
        "Author": "Danish Khan",
        "Content": "Vodafone Idea\u2019s March quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially as it continues to lose subscribers, even as bigger rival Bharti Airtel remains on the growth track, analysts have said as earnings season gets underway.    Analysts estimate Vodafone Idea\u2019s March revenue to fall between 1 percent and 2 percent but expect the pace of losses to slow as network coverage improves. They expect its 4G subscriber base to continue to grow on the back of network rollout.    \u201cWith an improving network coverage, we expect VIL\u2019s pace of net subscriber losses to slow down to 3 million in 4Q vs 5.1mn/5.2mn in 2Q/3Q. We believe that VIL is still some point away from showing positive net adds,\u201d BoFA Securities said in a note.    It expects average revenue per user (ARPU) to remain flat, resulting in a 2.1 percent sequential revenue decline.    \u201cWe expect Vodafone Idea to report a 1.2 percent quarter-on-quarter decline and 3.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue for Q4FY25, bringing it to around Rs 110 billion (approx. $1.33 billion). The drop is attributed to ongoing subscriber losses,\u201d ICICI Securities said. ARPU will likely remain flat despite two fewer days in the quarter.    Despite these pressures, analysts said Vi\u2019s 4G user base is likely to grow gradually, as its network rollout began in November.    ICICI Securities foresees a 5.2 percent decline in EBITDA for the quarter, affected by revenue pressure and an increase in expenses due to network expansion. But for the year, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are expected to see a growth of 3.1 percent at Rs 44.7 billion (approx. $538 million).    The company\u2019s net loss is estimated at Rs 76 billion (approximately $916 million), with no tax rebate considered.    Bharti Airtel    Bharti Airtel is likely to report a minor sequential dip in India mobile services revenue after 15 straight quarters of growth amid slower customer adds, fewer days in the quarter and also because it reaped full benefits of the rate hike in the previous quarter itself.    &quot;Our Q4FY25 estimates point to a mobile services revenue dip for Airtel (down 0.1 percent on-quarter) and Vi (down 1.2 percent on-quarter). But Jio's revenue could grow at 2 percent sequentially,&quot; ICICI Securities said in a note.    It forecasts Airtel\u2019s India revenue to grow 8.7 percent QoQ and 38 percent YoY at Rs 398 billion (approx. $4.8 billion).    India EBITDA is expected to edge up 0.1 percent QoQ on a like-for-like basis and surge 57.5 percent YoY to Rs 240 billion (approx. $2.89 billion).    BoFA also expects strong underlying business fundamentals for Airtel, forecasting a 2.5 percent QoQ increase in India's cellular revenues.    \u201cWe expect 4Q revenues to be impacted by Bharti exiting low-margin commodity wholesale voice business, partly offset by the whole 3 months consolidation of Indus Towers revenues, leading to a 13.7 percent QoQ rise in revenues,\u201d the brokerage said.    Morgan Stanley expects Bharti Airtel to add 4 million subscribers and ARPU of Rs 246 in the March quarter. For the core India business (excluding passive infrastructure), revenue is likely to grow 0.2 percent QoQ and 16 percent YoY.    \u201cThe decline in the enterprise business partially impacts this as the company is exiting low-margin businesses, which would have impacted numbers for part of the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a note.    It expects India EBITDA to rise a percent for the quarter and 8.6 percent YoY. \u201cWe expect higher dividend payout in F25 vs F24, outlook for capex numbers in F26 to be lower than F25 and reaffirmation of balancing capital allocation towards lowering debt and paying back to shareholders,\u201d the note added.    At 12.20 pm, the Vodafone Idea stock was trading at Rs 7.11 on the National Stock Exchange, up 0.28 percent from the previous close. Bharti Airtel was up 2.4 percent at Rs 1,756.40",

Sifting through the noise, we see: 1) EBITDA/te (overall) sustaining between INR 19,000\u2013 20,500/te; 2) volumes likely growing 10\u201311% p.a. through to FY27E; 3) lower impact from protectionism; and 4) subsidiaries being potentially value accretive FY26E onwards. While we tone down our FY26E/FY27E EPS by 12%/11% owing to the low level of prices and inadequate recovery in export markets, our RoE estimate of 16\u201317% through to FY27 is still higher than the carbon steel players.    Outlook  Our revised TP works out to INR 760 (earlier INR 850). Maintain BUY.

        "Title": "Chartist Talks: April charts signal strong market; SBI Securities' Sudeep Shah recommends 2 short-term stocks",
        "Date": "2025-03-23",
        "Description": "Sudeep Shah advised buying Axis Bank and PCBL for the short term, however, he is bearish on the Nifty IT index.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "After significant recovery in the passing week, and considering the current chart structure, Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities believes the April series will be very healthy for the market.    Further, VIX trades below both its short and long-term moving averages, market sentiment appears calm, signaling a return of risk-on mode to D-Street. A stable VIX typically supports a bullish outlook, paving the way for continued upward momentum in equities, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    Sudeep Shah advised buying Axis Bank and PCBL for the short term, however, he is bearish on the Nifty IT index. &quot;On a monthly scale, the Nifty IT slipped below its 20-month EMA level, and it is in falling mode. Most noteworthy, the 14-period monthly RSI is quoting below its 9-month average, and both the lines are in falling mode,&quot; he reasoned.    Is the rally sustainable? If yes, then will the Nifty 50 surpass February swing high next week or in the April series?    Just like a T20 game where momentum can shift in a matter of overs, the stock market has shown a stunning comeback this week ended March 21. After consolidating for a while, Nifty broke out on Tuesday and delivered a power-packed rally, closing the week at 23,350 with a stellar 4.26% gain. This was its best weekly performance since February 2021, proving that, much like cricket, market sentiment can change instantly!    The decline in volatility further reinforces this shift, with India VIX dropping over 5% during the week. As VIX trades below both its short and long-term moving averages, market sentiment appears calm, signaling a return of risk-on mode to D-Street. A stable VIX typically supports a bullish outlook, paving the way for continued upward momentum in equities.    From its recent low of 21,964, Nifty has surged nearly 1,400 points (6.31%) in just 13 trading sessions, which was much in line with our expectations. The index has not only crossed its 20 and 50-day EMAs but is now testing its 100 and 200-day EMAs. Meanwhile, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) remains in bullish territory and continues to rise, signaling strong momentum.    Hence, we believe the index is likely to continue its northward journey in the short term. However, much like teams pacing themselves in a long tournament, the market may take a short breather over the next 2-3 trading sessions. But just as every IPL match has its standout performers, stock-specific action is expected to remain strong!    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 23,130-23,100 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 23,600, followed by 23,800 in the short term.    Does the current rebound mean the April series will be very healthy for the market? Additionally, will the Bank Nifty hit December 2024 swing high in April?    Yes, considering the current chart structure, the April series will be very healthy for the market.    Bank Nifty has strongly outperformed the frontline indices, surging over 5% last week, which was its best weekly performance since December 2023. On a weekly scale, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing recovery. The index has decisively moved above its short and long-term moving averages. Notably, the 20 and 50-day EMAs are gaining upward momentum, while the declining slope of the 100 and 200-day EMAs has slowed significantly, which is a bullish sign.    Momentum indicators are also aligning with this bullish sentiment. The daily RSI remains in a strong position, continuing its upward trajectory, while the daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram suggests an acceleration in buying momentum\u2014both pointing towards further strength in the coming sessions.    Talking about crucial levels for the Bank Nifty, the zone of 50,100-50,000 will act as a crucial support area for the index. As long as it sustains above the psychological 50,000 mark, the path remains open for an upside move toward 51,100, followed by 51,700 in the short term.    What are your top two picks for next week?    Axis Bank    The Nifty Private Bank has given a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on a daily scale, which is a bullish sign. The stock has surged above 100-day EMA level for the first time after December 2024. Further, the 20 and 50-day EMA started edging higher. The momentum indicators and oscillators are also suggesting strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its upward journey and test the level of Rs 1,150 in the short term. On the downside, the zone of Rs 1,040-1,035 is likely to provide the cushion in case of any immediate decline.    PCBL    PCBL has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by above 50-day average volume. Further, the daily RSI surged above 60 mark for the first time after December 2024, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 420-425 level with the stop-loss of Rs 403 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 460 in the short term.    Do you expect the new leg of the rally in the Nifty Pharma index?    Yes, Nifty has marked the low of 19,633.95 in early March, and thereafter, it has started marking the sequence of higher tops and higher bottom on a daily scale. Further, the ratio chart of the index as compared to the Nifty index is started edging higher. Most noteworthy, it has surged above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is surged above 60 mark for the first time after January 2025. Hence, we believe the index is likely to continue its upward journey and test the level of 22,200 in the short term.    What do you make out of Nifty IT's monthly chart?    On a monthly scale, the Nifty IT slipped below its 20-month EMA level, and it is in falling mode. While the rising slope of 50, 100, and 200-month EMA has slowed down significantly, which is a bearish sign. Most noteworthy, the 14-period monthly RSI is quoting below its 9-month average, and both the lines are in falling mode. Hence, we believe the Nifty IT is likely to witness bearish momentum in the next couple of months.    Are you bullish on BSE?    Yes, recently, it has marked the low of Rs 3,682 on March 11 and thereafter started moving higher along with relatively higher volume. The stock has surged by over 29 percent in just 7 trading sessions. Along with this rise, the stock has surged above its 20 and 200-day EMA level. Further, the daily RSI is quoting above its 9-day average, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its upward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.

        "Title": "Chartist Talks: FII long-short ratio signals limited Nifty downside, these 3 stocks likely to continue northward journey, says Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities",
        "Date": "2025-07-19",
        "Description": "While the current FII long-short ratio points to a clearly bearish stance by FIIs, the extremely low long-short ratio also suggests that much of the negativity might already be priced in, leaving room for a potential bounce if any positive trigger emerges, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The FII long-short ratio has slipped to just 15 percent, the lowest in the recent period. Historically, whenever the FII long-short ratio drops below the 15 percent mark, markets often witness a limited downside, according to Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    While the current data points to a clearly bearish stance by FIIs, the extremely low long-short ratio also suggests that much of the negativity might already be priced in, leaving room for a potential bounce if any positive trigger emerges, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    He believes NMDC, KIMS Hospital, and GMDC are likely to continue their northward journey in the next couple of trading sessions. &quot;Despite of sharp upmove in the recent period, the momentum indicators are not in the overbought zone in case of KIMS Hospital, and GMDC,&quot; he said.    Given that the Nifty 50 has shown weakness for three consecutive weeks, do you expect it to break below the 20-week EMA (24,500) in the coming week, or is the worst behind us?    The benchmark index Nifty ended in the red for the third consecutive week, reflecting sustained bearish sentiment in the market. On the weekly chart, it has formed a bearish candle with a lower high and lower low structure \u2014 a classic indication of downward momentum. Throughout the week, the index made three attempts to reclaim its 20-day EMA but faced rejection on all three occasions. It is now trading decisively below the 20-day EMA, which has started to edge lower, further reinforcing the bearish undertone.    Additionally, the upward slope of the 50-day and 100-day EMAs has begun to flatten, signaling a potential loss of medium-term momentum. This slowdown in the EMA slope suggests growing indecisiveness and weakening strength among bulls. On the momentum front, the daily RSI is quoting at 43, marking its lowest level since April 2025. Moreover, the RSI is trading below its 9-day average, and both are in falling mode, indicating weakening internal strength and reinforcing the ongoing bearish setup.    Going ahead, Monday\u2019s trading session will be crucial for the index as heavyweights are announcing their Q1 results from Friday's market closing and Saturday. The reaction to these earnings could provide near-term direction and either amplify the current trend or spark a reversal.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 24,940-24,900 will act as immediate support for the index as it is the confluence of the 50-day EMA level and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of its prior upward rally (24,473-25,669). If the index slips below the 24,900 level, then the next crucial support is placed at the 24,700 level. On the upside, the zone of 25,130-25,160 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index.    Does the recent gap-down opening in Bank Nifty indicate further downside? Could the index potentially break its June low?    The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, also extended its losing streak, ending in the red for the third consecutive week. On the daily chart, it witnessed a breakdown from a Rising Wedge pattern on Friday and also slipped below its 20-day EMA, which is a sign of growing bearish pressure.    A key technical observation lies in the daily RSI behaviour. Despite a mid-week pullback, the daily RSI failed to surpass the 60 level, which is a bearish sign as per RSI range shift rules. Currently, the RSI is quoting at 45, its lowest level since March 2025, indicating a notable loss of momentum and growing weakness in the trend.    Going ahead, the 50-day EMA zone of 55,950-55,850 will act as immediate support for the index. If the index slips below the 55,850 level, then the next crucial support is placed at the 55,300 level. On the upside, the 20-day EMA zone of 56,700-56,800 will act as an important hurdle for the index.    After a strong performance last week, including Friday's session, do you expect further upside in NMDC?    Yes, the NMDC is likely to continue its upward journey in the next couple of trading sessions. The stock has given a consolidation breakout on a daily scale along with robust volume.    What are your top two stock picks for the upcoming week?    Dalmia Bharat    The stock has given a consolidation breakout along with robust volume. Currently, all the moving averages and momentum-based indicators suggest strong bullish momentum in the stock. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 2,260-2,240 with a stop-loss of the Rs 2,170 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,400 in the short term.    Godrej Properties    The stock has taken support near the Rs 2,192 level and thereafter witnessed a sharp rebound along with relatively higher volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. The daily RSI is about to cross the 60 mark, and it is in rising mode. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 2,370-2,350 with a stoploss of Rs 2,280 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 2,500 in the short term.    Do you expect the higher highs and higher lows formation to continue in KIMS Hospital and GMDC?    Yes, considering the current chart structure, both stocks are likely to continue their northward journey in the next couple of trading sessions. Despite of sharp upmove in the recent period, the momentum indicators are not in the overbought zone.    Based on the recent data, do FIIs appear to be strongly bearish on the market?    In the cash segment, FIIs have offloaded equities worth nearly Rs 17,000 crore so far this month, indicating persistent selling pressure. Simultaneously, in the derivatives segment, the FII long-short ratio has slipped to just 15 percent, the lowest in the recent period. This reflects an aggressive build-up of short positions and a cautious near-term outlook from institutional investors.    However, it\u2019s worth noting that historically, whenever the FII long-short ratio drops below the 15 percent mark, markets often witness a limited downside, as excessive pessimism tends to set the stage for short-covering rallies or a reversal in sentiment. While the current data points to a clearly bearish stance by FIIs, the extremely low long-short ratio also suggests that much of the negativity might already be priced in, leaving room for a potential bounce if any positive trigger emerges.

Jefferies on TCS    The international brokerage downgraded its rating for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) from 'Buy' to 'Hold' and cut the target from Rs 4,530 per share to Rs 3,300 per share.

It slashed the stock's target price from Rs 3,250 per share to Rs 2,300 per share. This however implies an upside potential of over 6 percent from the stock's previous closing price.    Mphasis shares plunged nearly 3 percent to close at Rs 2,109 apiece.    Jefferies on  Infosys, Coforge and Sagility    Although Jefferies had a 'Buy' call on the shares of Infosys, Coforge and Sagility, it cut the target prices them. The brokerage cut its target price for Infosys to Rs 1,700 apiece from the earlier Rs 1,835 per share. The latest target price implies an upside potential of nearly 19 percent from the stock\u2019s previous closing price.    Coforge's target price was reduced from Rs 10,350 per share to Rs 7,860 per share, implying an upside potential of over 21 percent from previous closing price.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices staged a strong comeback on April 11, with the Nifty 50 rising nearly 2 percent, tracking positive global trends. Bulls dominated market breadth, with about 2,191 shares gaining compared to 366 declining on the NSE. The market mood is likely to remain upbeat in the upcoming session. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities    KPR Mill | CMP: Rs 974.85        KPR Mill has witnessed a short-term trend reversal on the daily chart, forming higher tops and bottoms. The stock is well-positioned above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, reconfirming bullish sentiment. Rising volumes over the past couple of weeks indicate increased participation. The daily and weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in positive territory, suggesting buying interest at current levels. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating this stock. The expected upside is Rs 1,130\u20131,213, with downside support in the Rs 930\u2013900 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,130, Rs 1,213    Stop-Loss: Rs 930    Valor Estate (DB Realty) | CMP: Rs 174.5        On the weekly chart, Valore Estate has decisively broken out of its one-year down-sloping channel on a closing basis, indicating a trend reversal. Substantial rising volumes signal increased participation. The positive crossover of the 20 and 50-day moving averages indicates growing momentum and a bullish trend. The daily and weekly RSI is also in positive territory, suggesting potential buying interest. Investors are advised to buy, hold, and accumulate the stock. The expected upside is Rs 209\u2013219, with downside support at Rs 161\u2013155.    Strategy: By    Target: Rs 209, Rs 219    Stop-Loss: Rs 161    Cholamandalam Financial Holdings | CMP: Rs 1,780.4        Cholamandalam Financial is trending higher, forming a series of higher tops and bottoms, indicating a positive bias. The stock has recently reclaimed its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, with the averages trending upward along with price, which supports bullish sentiment. Strong volumes near the support zone further suggest buying interest. The weekly Bollinger Band buy signal indicates increased momentum, while the weekly and monthly RSI is also in favourable territory. Investors should consider buying, holding, and accumulating. The expected upside is Rs 1,985\u20132,100, with downside support in the Rs 1,630\u20131,580 zone.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,985, Rs 2,100    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,630    Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi    ITC | CMP: Rs 421.55        In the last session, ITC broke above the R3 Camarilla Pivot resistance of Rs 417 and closed strong, signaling a bullish breakout after consolidating between Rs 390\u2013415. The RSI, which held near 40 during the consolidation, is now above 60, supporting the bullish outlook. This breakout, supported by momentum indicators, suggests potential upside in the upcoming sessions. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 420\u2013422 zone, with an upside target of Rs 444.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 444    Stop-Loss: Rs 410    Clean Science and Technology | CMP: Rs 1,180.95        Clean Science has recently formed a textbook bullish Bat pattern on the daily chart, supported by rising volumes from the bottom, indicating strong buying interest. Notably, the Bat pattern\u2019s reversal zone aligns with the S3 monthly Camarilla pivot, adding technical confluence. Additionally, an Inside Value relationship is observed between March and April pivots, where April\u2019s R3 and S3 lie within March\u2019s range. This setup often precedes a significant breakout, hinting at a potentially explosive move. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 1,175\u20131,185 zone, targeting Rs 1,300.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,300    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,120    Shree Renuka Sugars | CMP: Rs 26.98        On the daily chart, RSI for Shree Renuka Sugars has shown bullish divergence near the key support zone of Rs 25\u201326, indicating potential reversal strength. A classic Hammer candlestick has also formed around this support area, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Moreover, the Inside Value relationship between March and April Camarilla pivots\u2014where April\u2019s R3 and S3 lie within March\u2019s range\u2014suggests price compression. This combination of technical signals points toward a likely breakout. Traders may consider entering long positions in the Rs 26\u201327 zone, targeting Rs 31.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 31    Stop-Loss: Rs 24    Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One    ACC | CMP: Rs 2,007.35        ACC has shown impressive growth, climbing nearly Rs 200 in recent trading weeks. This surge has been accompanied by an increase in average trading volumes, indicating building market interest and a potential trend reversal. The stock has also surpassed its 51-day EMA after a prolonged period. Additionally, the 14-period RSI has risen above its previous swing high, reinforcing the bullish momentum. These indicators suggest that ACC may be entering a period of sustained growth. We recommend buying around Rs 2,000\u20131,980, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,870, targeting Rs 2,200.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,200    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870    Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation | CMP: Rs 1,206.45        Deepak Fertilisers has seen a solid recovery following a consolidation phase and is now positioned above all major EMAs, including the 200-day SMA. Recent buying activity has been backed by rising volumes, indicating positive developments. Furthermore, the stock is comfortably above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction, enhancing the bullish outlook. The MACD indicator also shows a positive crossover above the zero signal line, suggesting building momentum. Hence, we recommend buying around Rs 1,200\u20131,180.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,300, Rs 1,360    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,100    Gujarat Gas | CMP: Rs 428.3        Gujarat Gas has experienced a strong resurgence in recent weeks, resulting in a robust weekly close. The stock is now trading above all its 50-day EMAs on the daily chart after a prolonged period, reflecting inherent strength and likely continuation of the trend. A breakout from the previous swing high, backed by strong volumes, adds to the bullish narrative. We recommend buying on dips around Rs 410\u2013400.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 440, Rs 460    Stop-Loss: Rs 380    Jay Thakkar, Vice President &amp;amp; Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities    Grasim Industries Futures | CMP: Rs 2,662        Grasim has seen strong Put additions in the previous trading session from the Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,660 strikes, along with Call unwinding at those levels. This activity helped the PCR return to a neutral level, now at 1. The highest Put open interest is at the Rs 2,500 strike, while Calls are still concentrated between Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,680, which may unwind further as the stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 2,600 and Rs 2,596, respectively.    Grasim is also trading above its 20-day VWAP, which is around Rs 2,550. There were a few short positions added in the previous leg, and despite that, the price moved higher, which could lead to short covering in the upcoming sessions. Buy Grasim Futures in the range of Rs 2,660 to Rs 2,630.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,730, Rs 2,780    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,570    Aurobindo Pharma Futures | CMP: Rs 1,089.2        Aurobindo Pharma had previously corrected mainly due to long unwinding, and currently, there are not many short positions in the stock. From a positioning standpoint, it remains relatively light in the broader market. The PCR improved in the last trading session to 0.72, primarily due to significant Put writing from the Rs 980 to Rs 1,100 strikes, along with Call unwinding from Rs 1,060 to RS 1,100 strikes.    The highest Call open interest is at Rs 1,200, which also aligns with the short-term target. The stop-loss is placed at Rs 1,040, offering a favourable risk-reward ratio for the bulls. While the stock is trading below its 20-day VWAP and maximum pain level\u2014which could act as near-term resistance\u2014the recent options activity indicates a high probability of these levels being challenged. Buy Aurobindo Pharma Futures in the range of Rs 1,090 to Rs 1,070.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,200, Rs 1,260    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040    Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices fell more than 1 percent on May 20 due to profit booking, following a couple of days of consolidation, with market breadth weakening. A total of 1,893 shares saw selling pressure compared to 710 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is likely to continue trading in a range within last Thursday\u2019s high and low. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP-technical Research at Kotak Securities    Steel Authority of India | CMP: Rs 122.52    After a remarkable upward move, SAIL has been consolidating over the last few sessions. The current consolidation structure suggests a bullish continuation chart pattern. Moreover, the stock has comfortably closed above its short-term moving average. Therefore, the stock is likely to resume its uptrend from current levels. For the next few trading sessions, Rs 118 could act as the trend-decider level for the bulls. If the stock sustains above this level, we can expect further upside towards Rs 131.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 131    Stop-Loss: Rs 118    ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 613        ICICI Prudential has shown a robust rally from lower levels in recent sessions. It is also consistently trading in an ascending triangle chart formation. This overall setup indicates a likely breakout and a new leg of uptrend from current levels. For positional traders, Rs 585 would be the decisive level. Trading above this level, the uptrend is expected to continue towards Rs 660. However, if the stock closes below Rs 585, traders may prefer to exit long positions.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 660    Stop-Loss: Rs 585    Oberoi Realty | CMP: Rs 1,699.20        Following its recent downtrend, Oberoi Realty has reversed from an important support zone. The stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the weekly chart and is in a steady uptrend. Technical indicators like MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) are also pointing to further upward movement, which could boost bullish momentum in the near term. As long as the stock trades above Rs 1,640, the bullish structure is likely to remain intact. A move above this level could take the stock up to Rs 1,820.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,820    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,640    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors    CCL Products | CMP: Rs 830.7        Following a strong Q4 earnings report, CCL Products witnessed a significant rally. In the previous session\u2014despite a broader market decline\u2014the stock gained over 9% with substantial volume, indicating increased bullish sentiment. Moreover, prices closed above the prior day\u2019s high after seven sessions, a positive sign.    The stock is currently trading near a critical resistance level of Rs 855. A decisive break above this could lead to a trending move toward fresh highs. Since May 6, prices have consistently stayed near the upper Bollinger Bands, indicating trend strength. The current trend favours the bulls. Use dips as buying opportunities, targeting Rs 865, followed by Rs 895, with Rs 795 as the nearest support level.    Strategy: Buy    Targets: Rs 865, Rs 895    Stop-Loss: Rs 795    Chennai Petroleum Corporation | CMP: Rs 675        Over the past seven sessions, Chennai Petroleum has consistently protected its prior day\u2019s low on a closing basis, keeping the daily bias tilted towards the bulls. At the start of May, the price found support at the Ichimoku cloud\u2019s base line (red line) and reversed sharply\u2014over 19%\u2014suggesting growing bullish control.    The MACD has given a bullish crossover, reinforcing the positive outlook. In the previous session, the stock closed above its earlier swing high of Rs 664. Follow-up buying is now required to sustain momentum. A break above Rs 685 could trigger a move towards Rs 705, followed by Rs 735, with Rs 664 as the nearest support.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 705, Rs 735    Stop-Loss: Rs 664    SRM Contractors | CMP: Rs 422.8    In the last session, SRM Contractors closed on a strong note, gaining 14.50%, despite overall market weakness, with volume surge confirming bullish sentiment. The stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern, and a daily close above Rs 430 will confirm a breakout. On the daily chart, the 15 EMA has already crossed above the 30 EMA, signaling a short-term bullish bias. After a sharp rally, buy-on-dips is the recommended approach. The trend remains bullish. Use dips towards Rs 415\u2013420 as buying opportunities for a target of Rs 450, as long as Rs 400 holds on the downside.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 450    Stop-Loss: Rs 400    Nandish Shah, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities    Power Mech Projects | CMP: Rs 2,887    Power Mech Projects has broken out on the daily chart from a downward sloping trendline drawn from the highs of August 23, 2024, and April 22, 2025. During the recent correction, the price found support at the 200-week EMA and bounced back. Momentum indicators like MFI and RSI are sloping upwards and are placed above 60 on the daily chart, signaling strength in the ongoing bullish trend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,200, Rs 3,350    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,620    JK Lakshmi Cement | CMP: Rs 873.35        JK Lakshmi Cement has broken out from a downward sloping trendline on the daily chart with higher volumes.

Meanwhile, the under-recovery thereon (estimated at INR 4bn annually) shall impact earnings for the next 3\u20134 quarters. NHPC has commissioned all four units of Parbati II (800MW) and 107MW of solar capacity in Apr\u201925. Subansiri (2000MW) is expected to be commissioned in phases by Q1FY27.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Solar Industries  In the current volatile markets, Solar Industries\u2019 (SOIL) stock has outperformed its peers. Its traditional India business continues to be on a stable footing and the exports and overseas segment is also expanding. However, we are quite enthused about the defence business, where the company is rapidly expanding its scale and scope. As a result, we expect a 35% CAGR in EPS through to FY27E (compared to FY24 levels).    Outlook  Hence, we expect growth in the high-margin defence business to sustain even beyond FY27E driven by steady capex and SOIL\u2019s foray into new domains. Taking cognizance of growth opportunities, we raise our P/E multiple to 70x (earlier 60x), resulting in a revised TP of INR 16,000 (earlier INR 13,720).

        "Date": "2025-07-11",
        "Description": "UBS said that mobile tariffs at the low-end have risen, which could result in operators limiting tariff increases at the lower-end plans.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Telecom players Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd shares sank over two percent on Friday, July 11, after international brokerage UBS downgraded its rating on the firms to amid expensive valuations.    The downgrade comes ahead of the sectors earnings results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. UBS downgraded Bharti Airtel from 'neutral' to 'sell', and Vodafone Idea from 'buy' to 'neutral.' This means that UBS no longer has any buy-rated stocks in the domestic telecom space. The price target on Vi was cut to Rs 8.5 per share, and the target on Airtel was trimmed to Rs 1,970.    At 11.45 a.m., shares of Vi were quoting Rs 7.19, down 1.9 percent, recovering some intraday losses. Airtel's stock was down two percent at Rs 1,926.2 apiece.    &quot;While we (and consensus) model a 10-12 percent price increase in late FY26, the probability of a delay cannot be ruled out as Indian mobile tariffs are now in line with global emerging markets,&quot; said UBS.    Moreover, UBS believes that mobile tariffs at the low end are now higher, which could result in operators limiting price increases at the lower-end plans. This, in turn, could limit revenue flow-through of price increases. &quot;Given these downside risks and valuations which we believe are expensive, we downgrade our ratings.&quot;    Vodafone India can substantially benefit from relief on government dues, visibility remains low. Continued delays in Government relief measures have impacted VIL's debt raising efforts, potentially jeopardising its three-year capex plan of Rs 50,000-55,000 crore.    &quot;We believe a full AGR waiver could add Rs 7.5 per share to Vodafone Idea's fair value and in our price target derivation, we build in a 50 percent probability of AGR relief, added UBS. Due to delays in both raising debt, as well as in any government measures, the company has continued to lose market share.    &quot;While our base case remains that there is a relief in some form or shape, given the Government's stated desire to maintain three private telcos, it is difficult to determine the manner, magnitude or timing of such reliefs. Considering all this, we would be stay on the sidelines for now.&quot;    On the Airtel front, UBS is expecting a 10 percent ARPU hike over FY25-28, with later years largely being driven by secular factors. Even the FY26 tariff hike faces the risk of being delayed or coming in with a lower magnitude than anticipated.    After the latest tariff hike, Indian mobile revenues are 0.8 percent of GDP, which is in line with other  emerging markets. Also, entry pricing per month is now 1.25 percent of GDP per capita, which is at the high end of the range of emerging markets, noted the brokerage.    &quot;While near-term tariff hike is priced in, we believe there are downside risks to mobile revenue growth estimates. Considering these factors, we believe valuations are expensive,&quot; said UBS.

        "Content": "Bank stocks recorded strong gains on March 12, pushing the Nifty Bank into green. The bank index has now broken its 2-day losing streak, despite the benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty recording losses.    IndusInd Bank shares were the top gainers on the index, rising over 5 percent to trade at Rs 693 apiece. The stock has snapped its 5-day losing streak. Notably, the rise in the share price comes a day after the stock crashed 27 percent after the bank reported discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio. The bank said the issue was estimated to impact 2.35 percent of its net worth.    However, the bank's management issued very optimistic views later, which may have boosted investors' confidence. Its CEO Sumant Kathpalia said the bank is likely to absorb the losses in the ongoing quarter itself. &quot;The full year won't be a loss at all. And I think Q4 will also be in profit...The bank will start seeing great profitability from Q1,&quot; he said while speaking to CNBC-TV18.    The uptick in the share price comes as the stock sees strong buying interest from investors by trading at a volume nearly 4 times higher than its 10-day average volumes.    The shares of heavyweight HDFC Bank also recorded strong gains, rising nearly 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,712 apiece. The stock has now snapped its 3-day losing streak to trade in the green. The rise in the bank's stock was the top contributor to Nifty Bank's rise. The stock is currently hovering near its 52-week high of Rs 1,880 per share.    Kotak Mahindra Bank shares jumped over 2 percent to trade at Rs 1,982 apiece. Earlier in the day, the stock jumped further to hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,998 per share. It is currently significantly higher than its 52-week low of Rs 1,544 per share.    While the three bank stocks kept the bank index in the green, some of their peers were trading in the red with strong losses. AU Small Finance Bank shares were down over 3 percent to trade at Rs 506 apiece. The stock has now tumbled over 8 percent in 4 days.    Punjab National Bank (PNB), Axis Bank and IDFC First Bank were down over 2 percent each. Canara Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) fell over 1 percent each, while Federal Bank, ICICI Bank and Bank of Baroda were trading with marginal losses.    The negative returns seen by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI were the top draggers in the index.    &quot;The charts of Bank Nifty indicate that it may get support at 47,700 followed by 47,400 and 47,000.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The market entered into a consolidation phase after recording more than a 1 percent rally in the previous session, finishing flat on April 29. The market breadth was slightly in favour of bears, as about 1,346 shares declined against 1,185 advancing shares on the NSE. The benchmark indices need to decisively close above the previous day's high for a further upward move; until then, consolidation may be seen. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Amol Athawale, VP Technical Research at Kotak Securities    Infosys | CMP: Rs 1,497.5        Post a declining trend, Infosys reversed from its important support zone. The stock has formed a rounding bottom chart pattern and is in a steady up move. The technical indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also indicating a further uptrend from current levels, which could boost bullish momentum in the coming horizon, making it a favourable candidate in terms of risk-reward perspective.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,445    Voltas | CMP: Rs 1,264.6        Post a decline from the higher levels, Voltas rebounded from its demand zone and witnessed a steady recovery from the lower levels. Additionally, on the daily charts, the counter has formed a higher-low formation. The gradual up moves in the counter suggest a new leg of a bullish trend from the current levels. As long as the stock is trading above Rs 1,215, the bullish texture is likely to continue, above which the counter could move up to Rs 1,350.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,350    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,215    Bharti Airtel | CMP: Rs 1,823.8        After the remarkable up move of the last few weeks, Bharti Airtel witnessed a short-term correction from the higher levels. However, on the daily charts, the counter is available near its important retracement zone. The formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels. For traders, Rs 1,760 would be the key support level to watch out for, above which the uptrend structure could continue towards Rs 1,950.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,950    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760    Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors    Bharat Dynamics | CMP: Rs 1,536.2        In the previous session, defence sectors showed good buying, wherein Bharat Dynamics managed to outperform its sector. On the daily chart, prices were earlier consolidating near the neckline of a Double Bottom pattern. At the start of this week, prices broke out of it and have shown a rally of more than 11% in just 2 days. The pattern target is much higher, so we can expect fresh highs in this stock in the coming weeks.    Additionally, on the daily chart, prices have just given a breakout above the upper Bollinger Bands, which is also a positive sign. In summary, the trend for the stock is bullish. A break above Rs 1,560 can lift the price further higher towards Rs 1,640 followed by Rs 1,720 levels. On the other hand, Rs 1,480 is the important support.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,640, Rs 1,720    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,480    Cochin Shipyard | CMP: Rs 1,652.4        In the previous session, Cochin Shipyard rallied 10% with the largest volume since July 2024. The stock had been trading within a downward-sloping channel for the past 9 months. In the previous session, prices finally managed to give a breakout from it, which is a positive signal.    On the daily chart, prices recently took support from the baseline (red line) of the Ichimoku cloud, and we saw a sharp bounce of more than 18% since. Post the sharp rise, the possibility of profit booking cannot be ruled out. One can use it as an additional opportunity to enter into the trend. The above view is valid as long as we do not see a close below the prior day\u2019s low.    In summary, the current trend for Cochin Shipyard is bullish. Use dips as a buying opportunity with targets of Rs 1,730 followed by Rs 1,800 levels. On the downside, Rs 1,565 is the nearest support to watch out for.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,730, Rs 1,800    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565    Max Financial Services | CMP: Rs 1,306.8        Max Financial Services has been rising steadily since April. In the previous session, the stock made a lifetime high. Also, the stock is following a simple bar technique method as it has managed to close above its prior day\u2019s high for the past two sessions, which keeps the overall tone on the positive side. On the daily chart, the stock has formed a rounding bottom pattern.    Prices have managed to close above Rs 1,306, which confirms the breakout of the said pattern. Since the RSI is also in the overbought zone, instead of catching tops, one should use a buy-on-dips method. In summary, the trend for the stock is on the side of bulls. One can use dips towards Rs 1,260 as a buying opportunity with targets of Rs 1,360 followed by Rs 1,420, as long as Rs 1,240 remains protected on the downside.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities's research report on IDFC FIRST Bank  IDFC First Bank (IDFCFB) reported broadly in-line set of numbers with Q1FY26 PAT of INR 4.6bn and RoA rising to ~50bps. Higher-than-expected slippages and credit costs were offset by strong treasury gains. Unlike peers, IDFCFB has, so far, strategically chosen to not cut its savings rate materially and is relying more on TD cuts (gradual impact) to offset yield pressure. The strategy aids in very strong CASA growth (~30% YoY; otherwise muted at systemic level), increases franchise value and adds optionality in the medium term. On the flip side, the impact on NIM (down 24bps) is bit steeper, and the recovery, too, could be gradual. Opex growth was well contained; bank remains confident of containing this growth at 11\u201312% YoY for FY26. Slippages rose QoQ, led by seasonality, elevated MFI and one wholesale exposure. PCR was stable QoQ.  Outlook  Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP of INR 80, valuing the stock at ~1.3x FY27E ABV. Key risk is higher-than-expected slippages impacting return ratios.

        "Date": "2025-05-06",
        "Description": "Sumitomo Mitsui may acquire up to 51 percent stake in YES Bank, allowing SBI and other rescuing banks from 2020 to begin exiting their stakes.",
        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "Private lender YES Bank Ltd.'s shares galloped over nine percent intraday on Tuesday, May 6, but settled 1.5 percent higher, after Moneycontrol reported that Japanese financial conglomerate Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) is back in the fray to acquire a controlling stake in the Mumbai-based lender. However, by the afternoon session, the stock had erased most morning gains.    State Bank of India (SBI) has reopened talks with SMBC to pick up a controlling stake in the Mumbai headquartered lender, sources told Moneycontrol.    SBI, which holds a 23.97 percent stake in YES Bank, is likely to sell up to 20 percent of its holding to SMBC, said sources.    This potential deal signals an exit route for public lender State Bank of India and other banks that stepped in to rescue Yes Bank in 2020, when the central bank had taken control following a liquidity crisis. In the first phase, banks like Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HDFC Bank are expected to partially offload shares to SMBC, with more divestment likely in later rounds.    At close, shares of YES Bank  were quoting Rs 17.98 per share on the NSE, higher by 1.4 percent, after trimming intraday gains. Earlier reports, suggesting that the Reserve Bank of India gave its approval to Sumitomo have been deemed 'incorrect', leading YES Bank's shares to pullback from the day's high.    YES Bank clarified that the bank routinely explores  opportunities with various stakeholders, aimed at enhancing shareholder value, and therefore, all discussions are preliminary and do not warrant a disclosure. &quot;The information pertaining discussions speculative at this time, not factually correct,&quot; said the lender in a filing with the bourses.    Follow our live blog to catch all the updates    As of March 2025, SBI held a 24 percent stake in YES Bank, with other key shareholders including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and LIC. Vervanta Holdings owned 9.2 percent and CA Basque Investments 6.84 percent. Around 62 lakh small retail investors, each holding up to Rs 2 lakh in authorised capital, together owned 22.55 percent.    Some assurances have been extended to SMBC to ensure that the deal sails through smoothly, especially with respect to voting rights and controlling majority, sources said.    Deal talks with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), another Japanese player, and SMBC did not fructify last year, as both financial majors were seeking dispensation on voting right limits.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on Whirlpool of India  Whirlpool India\u2019s Q4FY25 print was strong with likely market share gains in key categories of refrigerators and washing machines. With negligible price hikes, we believe revenue growth in Q4FY25 was largely volume driven. It also expanded EBITDA margins in-spite of lower gross margin. While higher scale of operations (operating leverage) helped, we believe there is possibility of lower brand building spends. With the parent planning to sell 31% stake in Whirlpool India and reducing its stake to 20%, we believe there is a possibility of multiple scenarios that may or may not be favourable for minority shareholders. As Whirlpool India has a strong net-cash balance sheet and also an established distribution network, we do not model any near-term business concerns. We shall closely track the key buyers (financial/strategic) when the parent sells its 31% stake. Maintain SELL.  Outlook  We model Whirlpool to report revenue and PAT CAGRs of 12% and 11.6%, respectively, over FY25\u201327E, and FCF generation to remain strong.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices remained consolidative for another session on February 27, closing flat-to-negative and extending the downtrend for the seventh consecutive session. Bears continued to control the market breadth, with a total of 2,162 shares facing selling pressure compared to 459 advancing shares on the NSE. The consolidation is expected to continue until the indices decisively break the range of the last three days on either side. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Chandan Taparia, Head Derivatives &amp;amp; Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services    SRF | CMP: Rs 2,854        SRF has retested its breakout from a consolidation zone on the daily chart, accompanied by higher-than-average traded volumes. The Stochastic indicator has bounced from its oversold zone, supporting the bullish sentiment.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,030    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,775    Berger Paints | CMP: Rs 505.25        Berger Paints has broken out of a consolidation zone and is inching higher despite broader market weakness. Rising volumes confirm the price movement. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is rising, supporting the uptrend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 528    Stop-Loss: Rs 493    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Bajaj Finance | CMP: Rs 8,705.4        Bajaj Finance has broken out from a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, signaling bullish sentiment. The price is consolidating above the breakout level, indicating strong momentum. Increasing trading volume and the formation of higher highs and higher lows further confirm the uptrend. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 71, trending upwards, reflecting strengthening bullish momentum. These indicators suggest the stock is poised for a rally. To manage risk, traders should set a stop-loss at Rs 8,200. If the momentum sustains, short-term targets of Rs 10,000 and Rs 10,200 could be achieved.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 10,000, Rs 10,200    Stop-Loss: Rs 8,200    Zomato | CMP: Rs 229        Zomato is forming higher lows while trading below a descending trendline on the daily chart, suggesting a potential bullish reversal. The stock has been consolidating near its key support level, indicating accumulation by buyers. Increased trading volume highlights growing buying interest and supports the possibility of continued bullish momentum. A breakout above Rs 235 could trigger a rally toward immediate targets of Rs 260 and Rs 270. On the downside, support at Rs 223 provides a favourable buying opportunity for investors. To minimize risks, a stop-loss at Rs 216 is advisable to safeguard against unexpected reversals.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 260, Rs 270    Stop-Loss: Rs 216    Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital    Aarti Pharmalabs | CMP: Rs 740.25        Aarti Pharmalabs has been trading in an uptrend, demonstrating strong price stability despite market volatility, highlighting its high relative strength.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities's research report on Indus Tower  Indus Towers\u2019 (Indus) Q4FY25 performance was good led by: 1) excluding acquisition, tenancy addition of 8.2k, which was much better than tower net adds of 4.3k, implying a rising tenancy sharing ratio. Tenancy adds benefitted from network rollout by VIL; and 2) strong FCF in FY25, including provision reversals. Indus has also seen a rise in rental/tenants, reflecting the benefit of rising 5G loading; but it may see a dip as tenancy sharing rises with VIL\u2019s rollout.  Outlook  We have baked in a dominant incremental tenancy share for Indus in the VIL rollout. We would watch Indus\u2019 efforts to build new businesses that can help grow earnings slightly faster. We increase EPS by 3\u20134% (FY26E-27E) baking in the Bharti Airtel towers acquisition. Accordingly, our DCF-based TP rises to INR 350 (from INR 335). Maintain REDUCE.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Dharmesh Shah of ICICI Securities expects Nifty to head towards 24,200 in April as it is an 80% retracement of the last leg of decline (24,857-21,965).    However, the move towards 24,200 would not be in a linear manner as bouts of volatility in the backdrop of looming US tariff announcement would prevail wherein, according to him.    The Vice President at ICICI Securities remains positive and advises buying Hindustan Aeronautics, Tata Steel, and PFC for April.    Technically, do you believe the Nifty is looking quite strong and could be heading toward the 24,000\u201324,500 zone in April?    The Nifty has staged the strongest up move that has helped the index to log a resolute breakout from the six-month falling trendline. Key point to highlight is that, the recent up move is backed by the faster pace of retracement as it entirely retraced past 19 sessions decline in just 14 sessions, indicating structural turnaround that makes us reiterate our positive stance and expect Nifty to head towards 24,200 in April as it is 80% retracement of last leg of decline (24,857-21,965).    However, mthe ove towards 24,200 would not be in a linear manner as bouts of volatility in the backdrop of looming US tariff announcement would prevail. Hence, buying on dips would be the prudent strategy to adopt as strong support is placed in the 23,000-22,800 range.    Are the private banks looking strong on the charts? If so, do you think the Bank Nifty will hit 53,000 soon?    The private banking space has been one of the leaders of the current pullback that witnessed a faster pace of retracement by retracing a five-week decline in just a single week, indicating a revival in upward momentum. This structural improvement helped Bank Nifty to resolve out of double bottom pattern formed above 100-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) after five months decline, indicating trend reversal that bodes well for extension of ongoing up move towards 53,500 as it is 80% retracement of past 5 months decline (54,467-47,702) coincided with December 2024 high of 53,888.    What are your top three picks for April and why?    We expect the index to trade with a positive bias amid global volatility, wherein stock-specific action would continue. Looking at the across-sector participation, we remain positive on the following stocks:    Hindustan Aeronautics    One can buy in the range of Rs 4,160-4,280 for the target of Rs 4,750 with a stop-loss of Rs 3,948. The stock staged a strong rebound from the 100-week EMA that helped the price to resolve above eight months falling trendline. The highlighting point is that the current up move is backed by the rising volume, suggesting larger participation in the direction of the trend.    Tata Steel    One can buy in the range of Rs 153-159 for a target of Rs 176 with a stop-loss of Rs 146. A breakout from nine months falling channel signifies the conclusion of corrective bias, in turn suggesting resumption of uptrend. Further, cooling off in the US Dollar index would provide a cushion for the metal sector.    Power Finance Corporation    One can buy PFC in the range of Rs 408-420 for a target of Rs 470 with a stop-loss of Rs 384. After correcting 32% from December 2024 high to the low in February 2025, the stock observed a base formation in the vicinity of 100-week EMA, despite recent volatility. The stock has now come out of the consolidation and witnessed a higher high-low formation, indicating the conclusion of the corrective bias, which augurs well for the next leg of the up-move.    Do you expect Nifty Pharma to hit a record high in April?    The Nifty pharma index has been consolidating after correcting 18% over the past six months. In the backdrop of the looming US tariff announcement, we remain cautiously optimistic on the pharma space and resort to a stock-specific approach. In the pharma space, we prefer companies with relatively lower US exposure, such as Cipla and Ajanta Pharma. Meanwhile, in the CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) space, we prefer players like Piramal Pharma, Syngene International and Laurus Labs, which is forming a strong base in the vicinity of long-term moving averages.    Do you see the possibility of a strong rebound in the realty space based on the weekly charts?    The Realty index has been forming a base around 100-week EMA after 30% correction seen over the past eight months. The current oversold condition warrants a gradual recovery in the space wherein stock specific action would be in focus. Further, RBI\u2019s rate cut would boost the sentiment for the sector and provide impetus for an extended up move. On the stock front we remain positive on DLF and Godrej Properties.    Does Glenmark look strong on the charts?    The monthly candlestick pattern of the Glenmark Pharma chart resembles a bullish engulfing pattern. The formation of the engulfing pattern after a six-month corrective phase indicates a rejuvenated uptrend that augurs well for further extension of the ongoing up move in the coming weeks toward Rs 1,700 while key support is placed at Rs 1,418.

        "Content": "Banking shares came under selling pressure on Tuesday, dragging the Bank Nifty index lower for the seventh time in nine sessions since April 23, as investors turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve's key interest rate decision due on Wednesday.    The Bank Nifty slipped over 600 points to move below the 55,000 mark at 54,271.40. 11 of the 12 constituents of the index settled in the red, reflecting broad-based weakness across both public and private sector lenders.    Bank of Baroda was the top loser in the pack, settling 10.91 percent lower at Rs 221.95 per share on the NSE after the PSU lender reported 7 percent drop in net interest income (NII) and a rise in provisions. Canara Bank followed closely, closing 5.22 percent lower at Rs 92.09 apiece.    Punjab National Bank fell as much as 4.93 percent to settle at Rs 94.50 on the NSE. IndusInd Bank dropped 2.64 percent, while Canara Bank declined 2.24 percent.    Selling pressure also extended to heavyweight names like State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which declined between 0.60 percent and 2.08 percent. Analysts attributed the fall to weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and broader uncertainty in the market.    Kotak Mahindra Bank on Saturday reported a 7.57 percent drop in consolidated net profit to Rs 4,933 crore for the March quarter of FY25, hit by rising stress in its microlending portfolio. Similarly, State Bank of India saw its net profit slip 8.34 percent year-on-year to Rs 19,600 crore for the January-March quarter, largely due to a decline in net interest margins.    Though SBI reported a 2.69 per cent rise in core net interest income to Rs 42,775 crore, its net interest margin dropped by 32 basis points year-on-year to 3.15 per cent, despite loan growth of over 12 per cent.    Private sector majors HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank also traded lower in Tuesday's trade.    Investor sentiment was further weighed down by uncertainty around the JSW-Bhushan Steel deal and global cues. Market participants are awaiting cues from the US Fed's policy stance, which will be crucial in shaping near-term direction for equities, especially rate-sensitive sectors like banking.    &quot;Globally, US markets ended slightly lower due to profit-booking after a nine-day rally. Concerns over US-China trade negotiations and the upcoming Federal Reserve decision are keeping investors on edge,&quot; said Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

The fall in ICICI Bank and Axis Bank's share prices dragged the index down.    DFS Secretary M. Nagaraju, in a post budget press conference, on February 17, attended by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, said the current financial year has been one of the best years in terms of credit growth in the banking sector. He added that the budgetary measures will boost cash availability by Rs 35,000-40,000 crore in the banking system. This will help banks to lend more into the private sector.

        "Content": "ICICI Securitie`s research report on Piramal Pharma  Piramal Pharma\u2019s (Piramal) Q4FY25 performance was impacted by a slowdown in its CDMO and CHG businesses. While new capacities in India should help Piramal revive growth in its CHG business, CDMO may stagnate and a recovery here may emerge in FY27. The company is on track to diversify its CDMO offerings and is investing USD 90mn to double capacity at its Lexington (US) plant and to add new capabilities in payload linkers at the Riverview plant.  Outlook  We cut our FY26E/FY27E EPS by 69.9%/31.2% to factor in a near-term slowdown in the CDMO business. New order inflow in the CDMO and CHG businesses and better revenues from on-patent commercial projects may drive revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs of 12.8%/21.2%/158.3% over FY25\u201327E with a 240bps improvement in margin to 18.2% in FY27E.

Outlook    Management anticipates 13-14% YoY growth in branded generics while US may grow faster at 15-19% led by new launches in FY26.

The transaction is subject to the necessary regulatory and statutory approvals including from the Reserve Bank of India and Competition Commission of India and will be subject to customary closing conditions,&quot; said Yes Bank in a stock exchange filing.

We are proud to invest in Yes Bank, a leading Indian bank with visionary leadership and a demonstrated track record of improving profitability. This investment aligns with our commitment to building lasting, value driven relationships in the region.

However, VIL lost higher-than-expected subs, and data subs dipped marginally by 0.1mn despite initial 4G network expansion. However, VIL has started accruing the benefits of network rollout with strong penetration of 5G subs and improving customer engagement (data usage), which remains critical for revenue growth. Government conversion of debt of INR 370bn into equity provides immediate relief and also helps to increase debt funding discussion intensity with banks, which is key for network expansion.

This confluence zone acted as a critical support level, and the stock responded with a sharp rebound over the last two trading sessions.

Importantly, the stock has now moved decisively above its short-term moving averages.

        "Date": "2025-03-09",
        "Description": "Considering the current chart structure, Manappuram Finance and SRF are both likely to continue their upward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Technically, Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities believes the Nifty 50 is likely to continue its pullback rally in the next couple of trading sessions.    Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 22,670-22,700 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index, however, the zone of 22,300-22,250 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline, he said in an interview to Moneycontrol.    He advised buying Shyam Metalics &amp;amp; Energy, and Paras Defence and Space Technologies for next week.    &quot;Shyam Metalics has given a downward sloping trendline breakout on a daily scale, and this breakout is confirmed by above 50-day average volume, while Paras Defence has given a neckline breakout of Adam &amp;amp; Adam Double Bottom pattern on a daily scale, which is confirmed by robust volume,&quot; said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    Do you see a strong possibility of the Nifty holding 22,500 in the coming week and reaching 23,000 before entering a sharp fall?    In line with our expectations, the benchmark index Nifty has not only experienced a temporary halt in its downtrend but has also staged an impressive recovery, witnessing a sharp pullback rally of nearly 600 points from its recent low of 21,965. Finally, it closed the week above the 22,500 mark, posting an overall gain of approximately 2 percent. The broader market has also witnessed a strong pullback rally as the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100 surged by 2.66 percent and 5.47 percent, respectively.    But what exactly is driving this strong pullback rally? A key factor has been the significant weakness in the US Dollar index, which tumbled by 3.4 percent during the week\u2014marking its steepest correction in recent times. This sharp decline has pushed the dollar index below both its short and long-term moving averages.    Further, Brent crude oil has ended on a negative note for the seventh consecutive week. This persistent decline in oil prices is a welcome development for oil-importing countries like India, as it helps reduce inflationary pressures, eases the trade deficit, and strengthens economic fundamentals. Such a scenario has proved to be a favourable tailwind for emerging markets like India as a weaker dollar, and declining crude prices typically improve liquidity conditions and ease currency pressures.    Technically, the index is likely to continue its pullback rally in the next couple of trading sessions. Talking about crucial levels, the zone of 22,670-22,700 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index as it is the confluence of 20-day EMA and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its recent downward journey (23,807-21,965). If the index remains above the 22,700 level, then we may witness an extension of the pullback rally upto the level of 23,000, followed by the 23,300 level in the short term. On the downside, the zone of 22,300-22,250 is likely to provide a cushion in case of any immediate decline.    Do the charts and technical indicators convince you that the Bank Nifty is expected to hold last week's low going forward?    The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, underperformed frontline indices in the last week. During the week, it has taken support near its prior swing low and thereafter witnessed a minor pullback rally. Finally, it ended the week near 48,500 level with a minor gain of 0.32 percent.    On the weekly chart, the index has formed a Doji candlestick pattern, indicating indecisiveness among market participants. Additionally, momentum indicators and oscillators reflect a similar sentiment, suggesting a lack of strong directional bias at this stage.    However, we believe the index is likely to hold last week\u2019s low. Talking about crucial levels, the 20-day EMA zone of 48,800-48,900 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index. If the index sustains above the 48,900 level, then we may witness an extension of a pullback rally upto the level of 49,700, followed by 50,500 in the short term, while, on the downside, the zone of 47,900-47,800 will act as a crucial support for the index as prior swing lows placed in that region.    What are your top 2 picks for next week?    Shyam Metalics &amp;amp; Energy    The stock has given a downward sloping trendline breakout on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by above 50-day average volume. In addition, the stock has formed a sizeable bullish candle on breakout day, which adds strength to the breakout. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. Most noteworthy, the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) surged above 60 mark for the first time after October 2024, and it is in rising mode, which is a bullish sign. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 825-815 level with a stop-loss of Rs 785 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 880, followed by Rs 910 in the short term.    Paras Defence and Space Technologies    The stock has given a neckline breakout of Adam &amp;amp; Adam Double Bottom pattern on a daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Further, it has surged above its 20-day EMA level. The 20 and 50-day EMA started edging higher, which is a bullish sign. Furthermore, the daily RSI is in rising mode, and it is quoting above its 9-day average.    Are you bullish on Manappuram Finance and SRF?    Yes, both stocks have been strongly outperforming the frontline indices for the last couple of weeks. In the last week, they both formed a strong base and resumed their northward journey along with relatively higher volume.    Considering the current chart structure, they are both likely to continue their upward journey in the next couple of trading sessions.    Do you see Apollo Tyres resuming its upward journey?    The stock of Apollo Tyres has taken support near its 200-week EMA level in the last week and thereafter witnessed a rebound of nearly 10 percent. Along with this pullback rally, the stock surged above its 20-day EMA level. Further, the bullish diversion is clearly visible on daily RSI, which indicates limited downside for now.    Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its pullback rally and test the level of Rs 430, followed by 445 in the short term.    What is your suggestion on Deepak Nitrite and Tube Investments of India?    The stock of Deepak Nitrite is on the verge of giving neckline breakout of Adam &amp;amp; Adam Double Bottom pattern on a daily scale. Going ahead, if the stock sustains above the level of Rs 2020, then it is likely to extend its pullback rally and test the level of Rs 2,100, followed by Rs 2,180 in the short term.    Since the last three trading sessions, the stock of Tube Investments of India has been oscillating near its 20-day EMA level. If the stock sustains above the level of Rs 2,800, then it is likely to witness a pullback rally and test its 50-day EMA level, which is currently quoting at Rs 3,012 level.    Do you think the Nifty FMCG index has finished its correction?    The Nifty FMCG index recently tested the oversold zone and witnessed a pullback rally last week, pushing the daily RSI to 38.97. However, despite this rebound, the broader trend remains bearish as the index continues to trade below its short and long-term moving averages.    Going ahead, the 52,500-52,600 zone serves as a crucial resistance level as it is the confluence of 20-day EMA and a prior swing high. A sustained move above 52,600 could extend the recovery toward 53,900, but failure to break this level may lead to renewed selling pressure.

        "Content": "The benchmark indices closed off the day's low amid rangebound trading, down 0.35 percent on April 3 after tariffs were announced by the US government. However, the market breadth remained positive for the third consecutive session, with about 1,851 shares advancing compared to 752 declining shares on the NSE. The consolidation and rangebound trading may continue in the near term. Below are some trading ideas for the near term:    Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking    Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders | CMP: Rs 2,737.55    Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders has broken out from a descending trendline. It has also retested the breakout level and formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern. A close above Rs 2,750 could trigger further momentum, with upside targets of Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,400 in the coming months. Technical indicators support the bullish outlook. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is trending upward at 68.4, indicating strong buying strength. Additionally, the price is trading above all key exponential moving averages (20, 50, 100, and 200 EMA), reinforcing the stock\u2019s bullish trend.    On the downside, immediate support is near Rs 2,600, offering a dip-buying opportunity. If the stock corrects to this level, it may present a favourable risk-reward entry. A stop-loss at Rs 2,520 is recommended to manage risk effectively and protect against unexpected volatility.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,200, Rs 3,400    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,520    SJVN | CMP: Rs 95.77        SJVN is on the verge of breaking out from a falling trendline with significant volume. The price is consolidating just below the breakout level, indicating potential strength. If the stock closes above Rs 97, it could trigger a strong upward move, with targets of Rs 110 and Rs 120. On the downside, Rs 91 acts as immediate support, offering a buying opportunity on dips.    The RSI on the daily chart stands at 59.66, rebounding from the oversold zone, which strengthens the reversal signal. Additionally, SJVN is trading above the 20- and 50-day EMAs, increasing the likelihood of an extended uptrend. At the current level, SJVN presents a favourable buying opportunity.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 110, Rs 120    Stop-Loss: Rs 88    Kirloskar Oil Engines | CMP: Rs 752.55        Kirloskar Oil Engines is on the verge of a breakout, forming a Cup and Handle pattern with significant volume. The price is consolidating just below the breakout level, indicating potential strength. If the stock closes above Rs 760, it could trigger a strong upward move, with targets of Rs 850 and Rs 900. On the downside, Rs 715 acts as immediate support, offering a buying opportunity on dips. The RSI on the daily chart stands at 60.2, rebounding from the oversold zone, which strengthens the reversal signal. Additionally, Kirloskar Oil Engines is trading above the 20- and 50-day EMAs, increasing the likelihood of an extended uptrend.

Buying was visible across the banking space, which may support the upward momentum. The RSI indicator is headed up to support the price momentum.

The RSI indicator is positively placed, which has bullish implications.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 730    Stop-Loss: Rs 675    Tata Communications | CMP: Rs 1,631.25        Tata Communications has given a range breakout on the daily scale and is holding its 50 DEMA support zones. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is headed up, which confirms the upward momentum.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,760    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,575    Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst at Samco Securities    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 779.2        State Bank of India (SBI) has been witnessing a steady recovery from recent lows, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, the stock is currently trading near a key resistance zone around Rs 780\u2013Rs 785, where a breakout could trigger a fresh leg of upside. The consolidation just below the breakout level, along with a rise in volumes, signals strong accumulation and buyer interest.    The daily RSI is trending upward and holds firmly above 66, indicating momentum is gaining strength. The stock is also holding above key short-term averages and supertrend support, which reinforces the bullish structure. A breakout above the immediate resistance zone could open the path toward higher targets in the near term.

The stock continues to trade above its 20-day moving average, reinforcing short-term bullish momentum.    The daily RSI stands elevated at 70, reflecting strong upward strength without entering an overbought zone. Notably, the stock has formed a classic Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart, a bullish continuation formation that adds further strength. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,680    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,495    Bharat Dynamics | CMP: Rs 1,343.5        Bharat Dynamics has witnessed a sharp surge in the last session, inching above its crucial resistance zone of Rs 1,325. This level had acted as a strong barrier multiple times in the past, and the current breakout, backed by a significant spike in volumes, signals a potential trend reversal and the beginning of a fresh upward move.    The daily RSI stands strong at 65 and continues to trend higher, reflecting renewed momentum. The price breakout is accompanied by robust participation, confirming strong buying interest. A sustained move above the breakout zone could unlock further upside, while the previous resistance now turns into a key support level. Hence, based on the technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP.

Consolidated revenue was up 8% YoY, mostly led by inorganic growth amidst muted industry volumes. Global demand trends in PV and CV segments are likely to remain muted in the near term.

Abbott\u2019s growth was aided by healthy traction in its own brands along with key brands of Novo Nordisk like Rybelsus and Ryzodeg. Cost synergies helped it post strong 380bps YoY EBITDA margin expansion. Timely price hikes on non-NLEM portfolio along with operating leverage may help it further improve margins in coming year.

Performance was impacted due to lack of revenue from a large innovative CDMO (-5.7% YoY) molecule and delay in shipment timing in CHG business (grew 1%). Impact of seasonality and de-operating leverage squeezed EBITDA margin to 5.5% (down 500bps YoY). However, management has maintained its mid-single digit growth guidance with mid-teen margin for FY26. Better utilisation at overseas facilities has improved the operating performance of subsidiary, and margins are expected to recover in H2FY26 as growth across CDMO and CHG biz picks up.

The sharp rise in the share prices pushed the Nifty Capital Markets index up nearly 2 percent to hover around 4,483 in the afternoon.    Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty rallied sharply, buoyed by multiple factors. While delivering his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted at the next generation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms to be announced as a Diwali gift for consumers. This significantly boosted optimism in the stock markets, pushing the benchmark index Sensex up 1,000 points, and Nifty over 25,000-mark.    International credit ratings agency S&amp;amp;P Global on August 14 upgraded India's long-term sovereign credit ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. Economists have positively reacted to the upgrade, stating that it reflects on India\u2019s prudent fiscal policy. A day later, S&amp;amp;P Global upgraded ratings of top 10 financial institutions, saying that India's financial institutions will continue to ride the country's good economic growth momentum. The positive commentary from the international ratings agency boosted market sentiment further.    The rising optimism pushed India Vix up over 2 percent. This likely benefitted the capital market stocks.    Anand Rathi Wealth shares were the top gainer on the index, jumping nearly 5 percent to trade at Rs 2,839 apiece.

        "Author": "Moneycontrol News",
        "Content": "The shares of asset management companies (AMC) saw profit booking on June 10 after the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) released data for the month of May. The net inflows in equity mutual funds dropped nearly 22 percent since last month to hit a one-year low of Rs 19,013.12 crore in May.    HDFC AMC shares tumbled over 2 percent to trade at Rs 5,112 apiece in the afternoon, while UTI AMC shares fell over 1.3 percent to trade at Rs 1,257 apiece. Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC shares meanwhile fell nearly 1 percent to hover around Rs 801 apiece.    ABSL AMC and UTI AMC shares rose up to 20% in the past one month while HDFC AMC shares rose 15%.    While inflows into equity mutual funds declined, the monthly inflows into mutual funds through the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) route rose by 0.21 percent to a fresh high of Rs 26,688 crore in May.    The overall net assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry rose to Rs 72.20 lakh crore for the first time, as against Rs 69.99 lakh crore in April. Overall, the mutual fund industry saw net inflows of Rs 29,108.33 crore in May.    &quot;The broader slowdown in equity inflows can be attributed to a mix of factors: a less buoyant equity market in May compared to April, concerns around global economic headwinds, and a possible consolidation phase or profit booking in the domestic equities following sharp rallies in the previous months and stretched valuations. Also, heightened global volatility\u2014stemming from geopolitical tensions with India launching Operation Sindoor against Pakistan and concerns around global inflation, contributed to a risk-off sentiment among some investors,&quot; said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director- Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India.    &quot;While the equity markets continued their upward momentum in May, gains were relatively subdued, potentially prompting investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach,&quot; Srivastava added.    Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net inflow of Rs 291.91 crore in May, marking an improvement from the marginal outflow of Rs 5.82 crore in April. &quot;The renewed traction in May signals a gradual return of investor interest, likely driven by resilient gold prices and sustained global uncertainties that reinforce gold\u2019s appeal as a strategic hedge. The uptick also shows that investors are regaining confidence in gold, as it continues to offer stability amid mixed signals from equity and bond markets,&quot; said Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst \u2013 Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India.

        "Author": "Debaroti Adhikary",
        "Content": "The shares of real estate companies recorded significant losses on July 28, as weak earnings by some of the players dampened investors' sentiment. Layoffs at TCS further fuelled the downturn in the sector.    The sharp fall in the share prices pushed the Nifty Realty index down more than 4 percent, to emerge as the top sector loser on the market today. The realty index closed at 911.90, extending losses for the fifth consecutive session.    Macrotech Developers (Lodha) shares were the top loser on the index, dropping more than 6 percent to close at Rs 1,198.70 apiece. The company on July 26 (Saturday) reported a net profit of Rs 674.7 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a 42 percent on-year rise from the Rs 475.3 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. On a sequential basis, net profit however declined 27 percent from Rs 921.7 crore reported in the January-March quarter.    The firm\u2019s revenue from operations meanwhile gained nearly 23 percent on-year to Rs 3,419.7 crore in Q1 FY26, but fell more than 17 percent sequentially from Rs 4,224.3 crore in Q4 FY25. Earlier during the day, Macrotech Developers shares dropped nearly 7 percent to hit an intraday low of Rs 1,190.60 apiece. The stock has recovered some losses now.    TCS is letting go 2 percent of its staff, or roughly 12,000 employees in a bid to become more agile and future-ready, Moneycontrol exclusively reported. The IT giant's move comes amid rapid disruptions in technology. However, the firm's CEO K Krithivasan told Moneycontrol that the move was not a fallout of the adoption of artificial intelligence, but to address skills for the future. A downturn in the IT sector will likely have a ripple down effect on the real estate sector.    Heavyweights DLF and Godrej Properties dropped more than 4 percent and 5 percent respectively.    Brigade Enterprises and Oberoi Realty shares dropped more than 4 percent each.    Oberoi Realty on July 21 reported a net profit of Rs 421 crore for the first quarter of the financial year 2026. This marks a nearly 28 percent decline from the Rs 584 crore net profit reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.    Its revenue from operations declined around 30 percent on-year to Rs 987.55 crore, while net profit margin reduced to 39.22 percent during the quarter under review. EBITDA meanwhile stood at Rs 607 crore.    Along with the Q1 results, the company also announced an interim dividend of Rs 2 per equity share for its eligible shareholders. The record date to determine the eligibility of the shareholders set to receive the payment has been set on July 25 (today), and if approved, the dividend will be paid on or before August 7.    Prestige Estates and Raymond shares were down around 3 percent each, while Anant Raj, Phoenix Mills and Sobha shares were down over 2 percent each.    Sobha had released its results on July 25. The firm's net profit more than doubled on an year-on-year basis to Rs 13.6 crore in Q1 FY26. However, the net profit dropped sharply from the Rs 40.86 crore reported in the previous quarter (Q4 FY25).

There is no clarity on which sectors will be affected by these tariffs, adding to the uncertainty and keeping markets range-bound.\u201d    Shares of Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) dropped 2.57 percent to an intraday low of Rs 1,123.2 per share on the NSE. HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd dropped 2.57 percent to an intraday low of Rs 3,734.8 per share on the NSE.

Strong equity performance in the 3-yr bucket is driving net flows\u2019 market share of 15.0% in Q1FY26. Due to new ESOP scheme of 2.5mn shares, we raise staff cost for FY26/27E by 2%/4%. Although a bit volatile initially, equity markets have delivered strong returns in Q1FY26 while industry equity flows have improved to Rs314bn in Jun\u201925 from Rs272bn in Mar\u201925.

        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "The benchmark indices closed flat with a positive bias on August 14, extending their upward journey for the second straight session, but the market breadth was in favour of bears. A total of 1,752 shares saw selling pressure compared to 1,128 shares that advanced on the NSE. The market is expected to remain in consolidation mode until it reclaims all key moving averages. Below are some short-term trading ideas to consider:    Osho Krishan, Chief Manager - Technical &amp;amp; Derivative Research at Angel One    Manappuram Finance | CMP: Rs 266        Manappuram Finance has demonstrated a robust recovery over the last couple of trading weeks and has now surpassed all major EMAs on the daily chart. The stock has retraced to the neckline of the breakout and has gained traction again, suggesting potential for increased momentum in the short term. The alignment of momentum indicators with the positive crossover among EMAs and a robust increase in trading volumes during the recent period indicates the likelihood of sustained momentum in the foreseeable future. We recommend buying the stock around Rs 264\u2013260.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 294, Rs 300    Stop-Loss: Rs 245    Titan Company | CMP: Rs 3,489.4        Titan Company has seen a decent surge in recent times, followed by consolidation resembling a \u2018Double Bottom\u2019 pattern on the daily chart structure. The stock has been hovering slightly above its 20 DEMA, with bullish bias. Additionally, the counter has witnessed a higher low formation on the daily chart and has showcased a positive crossover on technical indicators, adding to the bullish sentiment. The SuperTrend has also turned bullish after the recent surge. From a risk-reward point of view, the counter is firmly aligned with a favourable setup for the short to medium term. Hence, we recommend buying Titan around Rs 3,480\u20133,460.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,630, Rs 3,680    Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350    UNO Minda | CMP: Rs 1,149.8        UNO Minda has recently experienced a notable spurt in price and volume, characterized by a multi-week breakout. Additionally, the stock has been trading at new highs in the current calendar year, with favourable technical parameters suggesting a bullish bias. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator has demonstrated a positive crossover around the zero line, contributing to an optimistic outlook for the stock. Hence, we recommend buying UNO Minda around Rs 1,120\u20131,100.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,250, Rs 1,260    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040    Jay Mehta, Technical Research at JM Financial Services    Tube Investments of India | CMP: Rs 3,063.6        Tube Investments of India, after breaking out from a double bottom pattern, was trading within a wedge formation. Recently, it broke above the wedge and is currently trading above its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, approaching its 200-day EMA. A breakout above the 200-day EMA could further strengthen its bullish momentum. Rising volumes indicate strong buying interest, supporting the bullish outlook.    The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. On the daily chart, the RSI stands at 63 with a positive crossover, trending upward, while the rising MACD histogram signals robust momentum. A bullish Marubozu candle on the weekly chart reinforces the strong continuation pattern.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 3,400, Rs 3,550    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,844    TBO Tek | CMP: Rs 1,444        TBO Tek was trading in a descending triangle pattern since June 30 but recently broke out above it. It has reclaimed its position above the 200-day EMA and is trading above all key short- and long-term moving averages. Volume is gradually increasing on the positive side, indicating growing buying interest.    The daily RSI is at 63 and is maintaining its position above 50 levels, showing strong stock strength and suggesting that every small fall is countered with good buying interest. The rising MACD histogram supports continued bullish momentum. The stock exhibits relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty in the past 3 months. The immediate resistance is at Rs 1,508, and a breakout above this level could trigger a significant upward move.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1,582, Rs 1,600    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,363    PB Fintech | CMP: Rs 1,834.2        PB Fintech was in a long consolidation phase after a bearish gap-down on January 13. On June 4, it broke above the consolidation pattern, filling the bearish gap between Rs 1,800\u20131,840. Subsequently, it marked a high of Rs 1,978, then entered a tight wedge consolidation. On August 11, the stock broke out above the wedge with strong volume, signaling robust buying interest.    It is trading above all key moving averages, with the daily RSI above 50 and a rising MACD histogram, indicating sustained bullish momentum. The stock has shown good relative strength and has outperformed the Nifty over the last 6 months. The price can test the recent swing high of Rs 1,978, and sustaining above this level could open the path to higher levels.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 1978, Rs 2,100, Rs 2,170    Stop-Loss: Rs 1,709    Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking    Eicher Motors | CMP: Rs 5,764        Eicher Motors has recently given a breakout from a Symmetric Triangle formation on the daily chart. Prior to this breakout, the stock had undergone a consolidation phase at higher levels, indicating healthy profit booking and base building. The breakout has been supported by consistent trading volumes, reflecting strong participation and growing investor confidence.    If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 5,800 level, it could pave the way for further upside, potentially leading to new lifetime highs. Such price action would confirm the continuation of the prevailing bullish trend.    The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.14, trending strongly upwards, highlighting strengthening momentum and buying interest. Additionally, the stock is comfortably holding above all its key moving averages \u2014 short-term, medium-term, and long-term EMAs \u2014 underlining its strong underlying trend.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 6,350    Stop-Loss: Rs 5,475    HDFC Life Insurance Company | CMP: Rs 788.75        HDFC Life Insurance remains in a long-term uptrend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows over the past few months. Recently, after hitting a record high, the stock witnessed a healthy retracement toward its demand zone. From this support area, it has staged a reversal, also forming a Double Bottom pattern on the daily timeframe \u2014 a classic bullish reversal formation.    If the stock manages to sustain above the Rs 800 mark, it could further extend its bullish trajectory and head higher toward the Rs 875 level. Such a move would reinforce the prevailing trend and signal renewed buying momentum.    The RSI stands at 65.46 and is trending upwards, highlighting strong positive momentum. Furthermore, the stock has reversed from its demand zone and has reclaimed both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, signaling a revival of buying interest. From a price action standpoint, the formation of a Double Bottom coupled with a rebound from key support levels suggests that buyers are firmly regaining control.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 875    Stop-Loss: Rs 745    State Bank of India | CMP: Rs 826.55        SBI has witnessed a bounce from lower levels after a period of range-bound movement. Recently, the stock has been trading within a parallel channel, indicating a phase of consolidation with defined support and resistance levels. Taking support from the lower boundary of this channel, the stock is now showing early signs of a potential reversal.    A sustainable move above the Rs 840 mark could act as confirmation of this reversal, paving the way for further upside in the near term. Such a breakout would signal renewed bullish momentum and open the door for a move toward higher targets.    The RSI is at 62.71, trending upwards, indicating improving strength in the underlying trend. Additionally, SBI has taken support from its long-term EMA and has successfully moved above both its short-term and medium-term EMAs, highlighting a strengthening technical structure. From a price action perspective, the channel support and EMA alignment suggest that buyers are gradually regaining control, with the current zone offering a favourable risk-reward setup.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 910    Stop-Loss: Rs 785    Om Mehra, Technical Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities    Aditya Birla Capital | CMP: Rs 273        Aditya Birla Capital has rebounded from the 50-day SMA, while the 20-day SMA and the 9-DEMA are providing layered support beneath the current price.

The MACD has crossed above the zero line, with the histogram turning positive, supporting the emerging bullish tone. There has been a decent rise in delivery-based participation, highlighting that the trend continuation is likely to remain intact. The price is now positioned above multiple moving averages, creating a strong base for a short-term pullback.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 286    Stop-Loss: Rs 266    Endurance Technologies | CMP: Rs 2,602.20        Endurance Technologies has moved above the mid-Bollinger band, signalling the early stages of a recovery phase after consolidation.

The weekly candle has a follow-up green close, hinting at the potential for expansion on the higher side.    A notable rise in volumes on up-days further validates accumulation at current levels. The overall setup suggests a continuation if the stock sustains above immediate supports.    Strategy: Buy    Target: Rs 2,740    Stop-Loss: Rs 2,530    GMR Airports | CMP: Rs 90.77        GMR Airports has registered a strong bounce from the lower boundary of a falling channel.

The stock displays a cup-and-handle pattern, providing additional confirmation of a bullish setup.    The RSI has improved to 53 from the neutral zone, suggesting strengthening momentum. The MACD is edging toward a potential bullish crossover. The stock\u2019s recent rebound also aligns with the neckline zone of a prior cup formation, adding strength.

        "Date": "2025-07-13",
        "Description": "Technical signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength in Nifty 50, said Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities.",
        "Author": "Sunil Shankar Matkar",
        "Content": "Sudeep Shah of SBI Securities is bullish on EID Parry and Prestige Estates Projects. \u201cEID Parry has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, while the technical structure suggests that Prestige Estates may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term,\u201d he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.    He also maintains a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes \u2014 a strong technical confirmation of trend strength.    However, he recommends avoiding Bharti Airtel for now. After an 81% rally in the past 24 weeks, \u201cthe weekly RSI falls into the extreme overbought territory for RBL Bank,\u201d said the Deputy Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities.    Have you noticed Bank Nifty forming a double bottom pattern, a bullish reversal setup, on the daily chart? Does this indicate a possible rebound?    Bank Nifty is currently trading near its prior swing low, which raises the possibility of a double bottom formation. However, for this pattern to be validated, more price action and a confirmed breakout above the neckline would be essential.    Interestingly, the index is also hovering near an upward sloping trendline support, which lends additional technical strength to this zone. That said, confirmation is still pending, and traders should remain cautious until a clearer reversal signal emerges.    Adding to the uncertainty, Bank Nifty moved within a tight range of just 756 points last week \u2014 its narrowest weekly range since August 2024 \u2014 highlighting indecision and a lack of strong directional bias. On the weekly chart, the formation of a small-bodied bearish candle with a long upper shadow further signals selling pressure at higher levels, often associated with profit-booking or cautious sentiment.    Currently, the index is oscillating around its 20-day EMA, marking a crucial inflection zone. Momentum indicators are not offering strong cues either, with the daily RSI stuck in a sideways zone, reflecting a lack of conviction.    Going forward, 56,200\u201356,300 remains an important support zone, while the 57,100\u201357,200 area will act as a key resistance. A decisive breakout beyond this range \u2014 especially a move above the neckline if the double bottom develops \u2014 would pave the way for a stronger directional move, potentially confirming a bullish reversal.    Do you see a strong possibility of a bounce-back in the Nifty 50 after initial weakness next week?    The benchmark Nifty index spent the first four trading sessions of the week trapped in a tight 200-point range, reflecting the indecision among market participants. But on Friday, the calm broke. The index opened with a sharp gap down, slipped below its consolidation zone, and faced renewed selling pressure, signaling that sentiment is beginning to tilt in favor of the bears.    What\u2019s more alarming is that Nifty has now slipped below its crucial 20-day EMA, which has also begun to slope downward \u2014 a classic sign of emerging weakness. The momentum indicators aren\u2019t painting a comforting picture either. The daily RSI has given a bearish crossover and continues to head south, while the MACD histogram has flipped into negative territory. Collectively, these signals suggest that downside momentum may be gaining strength.    From a technical standpoint, immediate support now lies in the 24,900\u201324,850 zone, where the 50-day EMA is placed. A break below 24,850 could push the index toward the next key support at 24,550. On the flip side, a move above the 25,300\u201325,350 zone is required for bulls to regain control in the short term.    Amid this technical caution, macro and earnings uncertainties are only adding to investor anxiety. With tariff uncertainty rising globally and Q1 earnings just getting started\u2014kicked off by TCS on Thursday\u2014markets are entering a critical phase. Investors are now watching for signs of margin pressures, global demand outlooks, and forward guidance from corporates. In this tug-of-war between technical breakdowns and earnings expectations, a cautious and stock-specific approach may be the best strategy for now.    What are your top two buying ideas for the coming week, and what are the justifications behind those picks?    EID Parry    The stock has delivered a decisive breakout from its consolidation phase on the daily chart, signaling a fresh leg of the uptrend. What makes this breakout significant is the accompanying surge in volume, lending strong conviction to the move. Notably, the stock has been consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, highlighting growing investor interest and relative strength. As the stock is trading at an all-time high, all the moving averages and momentum-based setups are showing strong bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,155-1,145 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,100 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,260 in the short term.    Prestige Estates Projects    The stock registered a swing high of Rs 1,761 on June 24, followed by a throwback phase that was accompanied by subdued volumes \u2014 a sign of healthy profit booking rather than trend reversal. Notably, the correction found support near the 34-day EMA. Post this pullback, the stock has resumed its upward journey, supported by a noticeable rise in volume, adding conviction to the ongoing rebound. Over the past few sessions, it has been outperforming the frontline indices, signaling renewed strength and relative leadership.    Momentum indicators are now turning increasingly positive. The daily RSI is comfortably placed in bullish territory, while other oscillators are also supporting the ongoing uptrend. The technical structure suggests that the stock may be gearing up for a fresh move higher in the short term. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,690 level with a stop-loss of Rs 1,630 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 1,820 in the short term.    Is this a good level to consider buying Bharti Airtel, which has reached the swing high of May?    The stock marked a high of Rs 2,045 on July 02 and thereafter started witnessing profit booking. Since the last two trading sessions, the stock has witnessed a correction along with a relatively higher volume. Also, it has slipped below the 20-day EMA level, which is a bearish sign. Hence, we recommend avoiding Bharti Airtel for now.    Do you think RBL Bank is on the verge of a rounding bottom breakout on the weekly chart, or is it currently looking oversold?    Yes, on the weekly chart, RBL Bank appears to be on the verge of a Rounding Bottom breakout \u2014 a bullish continuation pattern that typically indicates a shift from accumulation to a sustained uptrend. The price structure suggests growing strength, and a breakout above the neckline could confirm a long-term trend reversal.    However, it's important to note that over the past 24 weeks, the stock has already rallied over 81%, indicating a sharp and extended move. As a result, the weekly RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which falls into the extreme overbought territory as per RSI range shift principles.    While the broader structure remains positive, the elevated RSI suggests that a near-term pause or consolidation cannot be ruled out before the stock attempts a confirmed breakout. Traders should watch for volume confirmation and price stability near the breakout zone for higher conviction.    Is Dabur a compelling buy at current levels, considering the chart pattern and momentum indicators?    Dabur has been showing strong relative strength, consistently outperforming the frontline indices over the past few sessions. The recent price action is backed by robust volumes and strong bullish momentum, suggesting growing investor interest and positive sentiment around the stock.    However, from a momentum standpoint, there\u2019s a need for caution. The daily RSI is currently hovering around the 80 mark, which signals an overbought condition as per RSI range shift principles. This suggests that while the broader trend remains positive, the stock may be due for a short-term pause or consolidation before it resumes its next leg of the uptrend.    In summary, while Dabur continues to show promise, fresh entries may be better timed after a mild pullback or consolidation, offering a more favourable risk-reward setup.    What is your view on SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, both of which had a strong rally in the past week?    We maintain a bullish view on both SBFC Finance and Ramco Cements, as both stocks have delivered decisive breakouts backed by robust volumes \u2014 a strong technical confirmation of trend strength.    In both cases, the price action is well-supported by rising moving averages, and momentum-based indicators are firmly in bullish territory, signaling that the underlying trend remains healthy and intact.    The recent rally suggests renewed buying interest and strong participation from market participants. As long as the breakout levels are protected, both stocks are well-positioned to extend their upward momentum in the near term.

        "Content": "ICICI Securities research report on AU Small Finance Bank  AU SFB\u2019s profitability, post merger in Apr\u201924, was impacted due to elevated credit cost on the back of higher-thanexpected delinquencies in its credit card (CC)/microfinance (MFI) portfolios and NIM compression. While near-term challenges persist, we believe RoA at 1.5%, as on Dec\u201924, has bottomed out and shall witness a steady uptick Q1FY26E onwards. Key drivers for RoA expansion would be: 1) normalisation in MFI credit cost to ~3% (9MFY25 credit cost at 5.41%); 2) course correction in CC business to pare credit costs and align with industry average of 6\u20137%; and 3) a falling rate cycle auguring well for cyclical recovery in NIM (~64% of assets are fixed price). On balance, we expect RoA improving ~30bps to 1.8% by FY27E.  Outlook  With likely improvement in profitability and the recent stock price correction (~15% in past 1\u20133 months), we upgrade the stock to BUY (Hold earlier) with a revised TP of INR 725 (earlier INR 625), based on ~3x Sep\u201925E BVPS (earlier: 2.5x).

It holds an overall market share of 11.5% and a 12.8% share in actively managed equity QAAUM, underpinned by strong brand reputation, consistent fund performance, and an extensive distribution network. HDFC AMC operates on a cost-efficient model, driving industry-leading profitability with a PAT-to-AAAUM ratio of 33bp. This lean cost structure supports strong cash generation, enabling a stable RoE of over 30%, significantly outperforming many financial sector peers. The company has witnessed robust retail participation, with SIP AUM growing 38% YoY to INR1.8t as of Dec\u201924, representing 37% of actively managed equity AUM. Furthermore, HDFC AMC commands a 24% share of unique mutual fund investors, reinforcing its leadership in retail investor penetration.  Outlook  Looking ahead, we project equity AUM growth of 55%/12%/18% in FY25/FY26/FY27. FY26 is anticipated to start on a weaker note in terms of AUM growth.
